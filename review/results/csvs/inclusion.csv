In this paper, we investigate the problem of assessing the quality of articles in collaborative authoring of Wikipedia. We propose three article quality measurement models that make use of the interaction data between articles and their contributors derived from the article edit history. Our Basic model is designed based on the mutual dependency between article quality and their author authority. The PeerReview model introduces the review behavior into measuring article quality. Finally, our ProbReview models extend PeerReview with partial reviewership of contributors as they edit various portions of the articles.

This is significant because in other domains, fruitful cooperation has proven to be difficult to sustain as the size of the collaboration increases.

With the increasing use of Wikipedia, the need for a reliable assessment of the quality of the content is also rising. In this study, we model the evolution of content quality in Wikipedia articles in order to estimate the fraction of time during which articles retain high-quality status. To evaluate the model, we assess the quality of Wikipedia's featured and non-featured articles. We show how the model reproduces consistent results with what is expected. As a case study, we use the model in a CalSWIM mashup the content of which is taken from both highly reliable sources and Wikipedia, which may be less so.

It is an enormous repository of information with free access and edition, created by the community in a collaborative manner. However, this large amount of information, made available democratically and virtually without any control, raises questions about its relative quality. In this work we explore a significant number of quality indicators, some of them proposed by us and used here for the first time, and study their capability to assess the quality of Wikipedia articles. Furthermore, we explore machine learning techniques to combine these quality indicators into one single assessment judgment. Through experiments, we show that the most important quality indicators are the easiest ones to extract, namely, textual features related to length, structure and style. We were also able to determine which indicators did not contribute significantly to the quality assessment.

15,Learning to Predict the Quality of Contributions to Wikipedia,Google Scholar,2008,Gregory Druck; Gerome Miklau; Andrew McCallum,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,11,67,"Although some have argued that Wikipedia's open edit policy is one of the primary reasons for its success, it also raises concerns about quality --- vandalism, bias, and errors can be problems. Despite these challenges, Wikipedia articles are often (perhaps surprisingly) of high quality, which many attribute to both the dedicated Wikipedia community and ``good Samaritan"" users. As Wikipedia continues to grow, however, it becomes more difficult for these users to keep up with the increasing number of articles and edits. This motivates the development of tools to assist users in creating and maintaining quality. In this paper, we propose metrics that quantify the quality of contributions to Wikipedia through implicit feedback from the community. We then learn discriminative probabilistic models that predict the quality of a new edit using features of the changes made, the author of the edit, and the article being edited. Through estimating parameters for these models, we also gain an understanding of factors that influence quality. We advocate using edit quality predictions and information gleaned from model analysis not to place restrictions on editing, but to instead alert users to potential quality problems, and to facilitate the development of additional incentives for contributors. We evaluate the edit quality prediction models on the Spanish Wikipedia. Experiments demonstrate that the models perform better when given access to content-based features of the edit, rather than only features of contributing user. This suggests that a user-based solution to the Wikipedia quality problem may not be sufficient.",N/A,https://www.academia.edu/158338/Learning_to_Predict_the_Quality_of_Contributions_to_Wikipedia,https://maroo.cs.umass.edu/getpdf.php?id=834,1,0,1,1,3,No,No

Existing research on quality assessment of user-generated content deals with the classification as to whether the content is high-quality or low-quality. This paper goes one step further: it targets the prediction of quality flaws, this way providing specific indications in which respects low-quality content needs improvement. The prediction is based on user-defined cleanup tags, which are commonly used in many Web applications to tag content that has some shortcomings. We apply this approach to the English Wikipedia, which is the largest and most popular user-generated knowledge source on the Web. We present an automatic mining approach to identify the existing cleanup tags, which provides us with a training corpus of labeled Wikipedia articles. We argue that common binary or multiclass classification approaches are ineffective for the prediction of quality flaws and hence cast quality flaw prediction as a one-class classification problem. We develop a quality flaw model and employ a dedicated machine learning approach to predict Wikipedia's most important quality flaws. Since in the Wikipedia setting the acquisition of significant test data is intricate, we analyze the effects of a biased sample selection. In this regard we illustrate the classifier effectiveness as a function of the flaw distribution in order to cope with the unknown (real-world) flaw-specific class imbalances. The flaw prediction performance is evaluated with 10,000 Wikipedia articles that have been tagged with the ten most frequent quality flaws: provided test data with little noise, four flaws can be detected with a precision close to 1.",User-generated Content Analysis; Information Quality; Wikipedia; Quality Flaw Prediction; One-class Classification,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2348283.2348413,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2348283.2348413,2,1,3,0,6,Yes,Yes

The algorithm assigns quality scores to articles and contributors. The scores assigned to articles can be used, e.g., to let the reader understand how reliable are the articles he or she is looking at, or to help contributors in identifying low quality articles to be enhanced. The scores assigned to users measure the average quality of their contributions to Wikipedia and can be used, e.g., for conflict resolution policies based on the quality of involved users. Our proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated by analyzing the obtained quality scores on articles for deletion and featured articles, also on six temporal Wikipedia snapshots.

To improve article quality, it is critical to first identify defects. Thus, flaw classification has attracted considerable attention. To achieve this, several machine-learning-based approaches are available, including deep learning models based on either manually constructed or autoextracted features. However, adopting only features of either single type may not ensure a comprehensive description of articles. To improve flaw classification, we propose a feature fusion framework combining both handcrafted and autoextracted features. In this research, we first use a rule-based method from a previously proposed framework to extract handcrafted features. Additionally, we obtain autoextracted features using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and various deep learning models, including bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi LSTM), bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi GRU), bidirectional recurrent neural network (Bi RNN), and multihead self-attention models. Finally, the handcrafted features are standardized and concatenated with the autoextracted features. Then, the concatenated features are fed into a feedforward neural network for classification. A detailed comparison of different classifiers is conducted. We compare 12 different classifiers in terms of training performance, classification performance, and model training time. The experiments show that the proposed feature fusion framework can notably improve the effectiveness of quality flaw classification for Wikipedia articles.

Using data on all English-language Wikipedia articles, we examine how the position that a category occupies in the classification hierarchy affects the attention that articles in that category attract from Wikipedia editors, and their evaluation of quality of the Wikipedia articles. Specifically, we show that Wikipedia articles assigned to coarse-grained categories (i. e., categories that occupy higher positions in the hierarchical knowledge classification system) garner more attention from Wikipedia editors (i. e., attract a higher volume of text editing activity), but receive lower evaluations (i. e., they are considered to be of lower quality).

This approach assumes that poor quality texts are deleted by editors with high possibility. However, many vandals delete good quality texts frequently, then the survival ratios of good quality texts are improperly decreased by vandals. As a result, many good quality texts are unfairly assessed as poor quality. In our method, we consider editor quality for calculating text quality, and decrease the impacts on text qualities by the vandals who has low quality. Using this improvement, the accuracy of the text quality should be improved. However, an inherent problem of this idea is that the editor qualities are calculated by the text qualities.

Design/methodology/approach - This study samples all the featured articles in Chinese Wikipedia and performs a Cox regression to reveal how participant composition and contribution behavior affect the quality of articles in different contexts. Findings - The results show that an increase in the number of participants increases the possibility of either enhancing or reducing the article quality. In most cases, the greater the proportion of core members (people who frequently participate in editing), the higher the possibility of enhancing the article quality. Occasional participants’ editorial behavior hinders quality promotion, this negative effect weakens when such editorial behavior becomes more frequent. Practical implications - The findings help to better leverage the role of online communities in practice and to achieve knowledge collaboration in a more efficient manner. For example, an appropriate centralized organizational form should be established in online communities to improve the efficiency of crowd contributions. And it is worth developing mechanism to encourage participants to frequently participate in editing the article.

Survival ratio based approach is a major approach to assessing article quality. In this approach, when a text survives beyond multiple edits, the text is assessed as good quality, because poor quality texts have a high probability of being deleted by editors. However, many vandals, low quality editors, delete good quality texts frequently, which improperly decreases the survival ratios of good quality texts. As a result, many good quality texts are unfairly assessed as poor quality. In our method, we consider editor quality score for calculating text quality score, and decrease the impact on text quality by vandals. Using this improvement, the accuracy of the text quality score should be improved. However, an inherent problem with this idea is that the editor quality scores are calculated by the text quality scores. To solve this problem, we mutually calculate the editor and text quality scores until they converge. In this paper, we prove that the text quality score converges.

However, if an editor edits multiple articles, and the editor is approved at a small number of articles, the quality value of the editor deeply depends on the quality of the texts. In this paper, we apply h-index, which is a simple but resistant to excessive values, to the peer-review based Wikipedia article assessment method.

Wikipedia being the world’s largest-ever community-based collaborative encyclopedia, is also one of the biggest UGC databases in the world. Wikipedia is dealing with a significant problem of Information Quality (IQ) because of its open-source and collaborative nature. When carrying out attacks such as link spamming, malicious users take advantage of Wikipedia’s popularity on the World Wide Web (WWW). As a result, Wikipedia is generally not recommended for academic-related work. There are, however, some articles that are both rich in information and quality. Existing approaches for assessing Wikipedia’s IQ involve statistical models and machine learning algorithms; however, the existing models do not produce satisfactory results. In this study, a novel theoretical model based on Google’s E-A-T framework is introduced to assess Wikipedia’s IQ. The model comprises three IQ constructs Expertise, Authority and Trustworthiness. Based on the empirical findings and study results, a set of IQ dimensions that influence the above three IQ constructs, as well as 45 IQ attributes to measure the IQ dimensions, were identified. The IQ attributes were automatically and inexpensively extracted from the content and meta-data statistics of Wikipedia articles using a Selenium 3.14 web automation script. A sample of 2000 articles comprising 1000 Featured Articles (FA) and 1000 non-FA articles from six WikiProjects was used for the data analysis.

133,Effects of Implicit Positive Ratings for Quality Assessment of Wikipedia Articles,Google Scholar,2013,Yu Suzuki,Journal,"Journal of Information Processing, vol. 21(2), pp. 342-348",N/A,N/A,21,10,"In this paper, we propose a method to identify high-quality Wikipedia articles by using implicit positive ratings. One of the major approaches for assessing Wikipedia articles is a text survival ratio based approach. In this approach, when a text survives beyond multiple edits, the text is assessed as high quality. However, the problem is that many low quality articles are misjudged as high quality, because every editor does not always read the whole article. If there is a low quality text at the bottom of a long article, and the text has not seen by the other editors, then the text survives beyond many edits, and the text is assessed as high quality.

One of major approaches for assessing Wikipedia articles is a text survival ratio based approach. However, the problem of this approach is that many low quality articles are misjudged as high quality, because of two issues. This is because, every editor does not always read the whole articles. Therefore, if there is a low quality text at the bottom of a long article, and the text have not seen by the other editors, then the text survives beyond many edits, and the survival ratio of the text is high. To solve this problem, we use a section or a paragraph as a unit of remaining instead of a whole page. This means that if an editor edits an article, the system treats that the editor gives positive ratings to the section or the paragraph that the editor edits. This is because, we believe that if editors edit articles, the editors may not read the whole page, but the editors should read the whole sections or paragraphs, and delete low-quality texts.

In particular, the focus is (i) on the analysis of groups of hand-crafted features that can be employed by supervised machine learning techniques to classify Wikipedia articles on qualitative bases, and (ii) on the analysis of some issues behind the construction of a suitable ground truth.

1001,Predicting the quality of user contributions via LSTMs,Backward Citation Tracking,2016,Rakshit Agrawal; Luca deAlfaro,Conference,"OpenSym '16: International Symposium on Open Collaboration, no. 19, pp. 1-10",Association for Computing Machinery,"New York City, United States",20,8,"In many collaborative systems it is useful to automatically estimate the quality of new contributions; the estimates can be used for instance to flag contributions for review. To predict the quality of a contribution by a user, it is useful to take into account both the characteristics of the revision itself, and the past history of contributions by that user. In several approaches, the user's history is first summarized into a number of features, such as number of contributions, user reputation, time from previous revision, and so forth. These features are then passed along with features of the current revision to a machine-learning classifier, which outputs a prediction for the user contribution. The summarization step is used because the usual machine learning models, such as neural nets, SVMs, etc. rely on a fixed number of input features. We show in this paper that this manual selection of summarization features can be avoided by adopting machine-learning approaches that are able to cope with temporal sequences of input. In particular, we show that Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural nets are able to process directly the variable-length history of a user's activity in the system, and produce an output that is highly predictive of the quality of the next contribution by the user. Our approach does not eliminate the process of feature selection, which is present in all machine learning. Rather, it eliminates the need for deciding which features from a user's past are most useful for predicting the future: we can simply pass to the machine-learning apparatus all the past, and let it come up with an estimate for the quality of the next contribution. We present models combining LSTM and NN for predicting revision quality and show that the prediction accuracy attained is far superior to the one obtained using the NN alone. More interestingly, we also show that the prediction attained is superior to the one obtained using user reputation as a feature summarizing the quality of a user's past work. This can be explained by noting that the primary function of user reputation is to provide an incentive towards performing useful contributions, rather than to be a feature optimized for prediction of future contribution quality. We also show that the LSTM output changes in a natural way in response to user behavior, increasing when the user performs a sequence of good quality contributions, and decreasing when the user performs a sequence of low-quality work. The LSTM output for a user could thus be usefully shown to other users, alongside the user's reputation and other information.",Reputation; Machine Learning; Wikipedia; LSTM; Neural Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2957792.2957811,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2957792.2957811,1,2,1,0,4,Yes,Yes

We compare different ranking algorithms that explore combinations of text-relevancy, PageRank, and extent of review.

While the basic model measures an article's quality using both the authorities of contributors and the amount of contribution from each contributor, the peer review model extends the former by considering the review aspect of article content. We present results of experiments conducted on some Wikipedia pages and their contributors. Our result show that the two models can effectively determine the articles' qualities and contributors' authorities using the collaborative nature of online communities",N/A,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4061345,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4061345,2,0,1,0,3,No,No

From counter-vandalism to task routing, basic machine prediction has allowed open knowledge projects like Wikipedia to scale to the largest encyclopedia in the world, while maintaining quality and consistency. However, conversations about how quality control should work and what role algorithms should play have generally been led by the expert engineers who have the skills and resources to develop and modify these complex algorithmic systems. In this paper, we describe ORES: an algorithmic scoring service that supports real-time scoring of wiki edits using multiple independent classifiers trained on different datasets. ORES decouples several activities that have typically all been performed by engineers: choosing or curating training data, building models to serve predictions, auditing predictions, and developing interfaces or automated agents that act on those predictions. This meta-algorithmic system was designed to open up socio-technical conversations about algorithms in Wikipedia to a broader set of participants.

Design/methodology/approach - The study investigates the impact of textual and content-based features in predicting the quality of health-related texts. Content-based features were acquired using an evidence-based practice guideline in diabetes. A set of textual features inspired by professional health literacy guidelines and the features commonly used for assessing information quality in other domains were also used. In this study, 60 websites about type 2 diabetes were methodically selected for inclusion. Two general practitioners used DISCERN to assess each website in terms of its content coverage and quality. Findings - The proposed framework outputs were compared with the experts' evaluation scores. The best accuracy was obtained as 88 and 92% with textual features and content-based features for coverage assessment respectively. When both types of features were used, the proposed framework achieved 90% accuracy. For information quality assessment, the content-based features resulted in a higher accuracy of 92% against 88% obtained using the textual features. Research limitations/implications - The experiments were conducted for websites about type 2 diabetes. As the whole process is costly and requires extensive expert human labelling, the study was carried out in a single domain. However, the methodology is generalizable to other health domains for which evidence-based practice guidelines are available. Practical implications - Finding high-quality online health information is becoming increasingly difficult due to the high volume of information generated by non-experts in the area. The search engines fail to rank objective health websites higher within the search results. The proposed framework can aid search engine and information platform developers to implement better retrieval techniques, in turn, facilitating end-users' access to high-quality health information. Social implications - Erroneous, biased or partial health information is a serious problem for end-users who need access to objective information on their health problems. Such information may cause patients to stop their treatments provided by professionals. It might also have adverse financial implications by causing unnecessary expenditures on ineffective treatments. The ability to access high-quality health information has a positive effect on the health of both individuals and the whole society.

To address this, we introduce transfer learning based on a pretraining multilanguage model to verify whether it is feasible to conduct cross-language flaw detection. Specifically, we chose the Advert flaw (containing content written like an advertisement) as our research objective; French, Spanish, and Chinese as the target language scenarios; and English articles as the source scenario. Multilingual BERT combined with a sequential model was used to extract semantic features and build classifiers. Moreover, we compared three strategies (direct transfer, fine-tuning transfer and nontransfer) to determine the best strategy for cross-language Advert flaw detection at different training sample scales.

The state-of-the-art solution for this problem relies on multi-view learning, where quality is considered a multifaceted concept that can be learned from human assessments. To this effect, features describing quality have been devised and grouped into views based on criteria such as text structure, readability, style, user edit history, etc. The tasks of determining the views and properly combining them require the assistance of an expert, which is hard to do in scenarios where they are overlapping or hard to interpret by humans. In this work we propose an automatic view generator, specially designed for the problem of automated content quality assessment with no manual intervention. Automatic view generation is achieved by finding clusters of highly correlated features. This process is performed iteratively, by automatically creating new clusters, evaluating them, and keeping those that perform the best. Experiments on three popular Wiki datasets show that our automated views are able to reduce the classification error of the original features by up to 20%. This happens by automatically generating views that are very similar to those manually built, while keeping only a small set of features to reduce noise and overfitting.",Multi-view; Machine learning; Information retrieval; Automatic text quality assessment,https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0957417419302830?token=2ACE3B215F31DCDCEB9EDD11457C8631344364F25A149D43F62D8220BCCF2C2DB0672AB7B7FA22D12E3A06518E84A90C&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20230315003537,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419302830,2,1,3,0,6,Yes,Yes
2029,Discourse Connective - A Marker for Identifying Featured Articles in Biological Wikipedia,Forward Citation Tracking,2016,Sindhuja Gopalan; Paolo Rosso; Sobha Lalitha Devi,Journal,"Research in Computing Science, vol. 117(1), pp. 109-119",N/A,N/A,17,0,"Wikipedia is a free-content Internet encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone who accesses it. As a result, Wikipedia contains both featured and non-featured articles. Featured articles are high-quality articles and nonfeatured articles are poor quality articles. Since there is an exponential growth of Wikipedia articles, the need to identify the featured Wikipedia articles has become indispensable so as to provide quality information to the users. As very few attempts have been carried out in the biology domain of English Wikipedia articles, we present our study to automatically measure the information quality in biological Wikipedia articles. Since the coherence shows representational information quality of a text, we have used the discourse connective count measure for our study. We compare this novel measure with two other popular approaches word count measure and explicit document model method that have been successfully applied to the task of quality measurement in Wikipedia articles. We organized the Wikipedia articles into balanced and unbalanced set. The balanced set contains featured and non-featured articles of equal length and the unbalanced set contains randomly selected featured and non-featured articles. The best result for the balanced set is obtained with F-measure of 83.2%, while using Support Vector Machine classifier with 4-gram representation and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weighting scheme. Meanwhile, the best result for unbalanced corpus is obtained using the discourse connective count measure with an F - measure of 98.06%",Wikipedia articles quality; Document classification; Featured article; Non-featured article; Word count measure; Discourse connective count measure. ,https://www.rcs.cic.ipn.mx/rcs/2016_117/Discourse%20Connective%20-%20A%20Marker%20for%20Identifying%20Featured%20Articles%20in%20Biological%20Wikipedia.pdf,https://www.researchgate.net/journal/Research-in-Computing-Science-1870-4069,1,1,1,0,3,No,No
2030,Detection of Article Qualities in the Chinese Wikipedia Based on C4.5 Decision Tree,Forward Citation Tracking,2013,Kui Xiao; Bing Li; Peng He; Xi-hui Yang ,Conference,"KSEM '13: International Conference on Knowledge Science, Engineering and Management, pp. 444-452",Springer,"Berlin, Heidelberg",11,1,"The number of articles in Wikipedia is growing rapidly. It is important for Wikipedia to provide users with high quality and reliable articles. However, the quality assessment metric provided by Wikipedia are inefficient, and other mainstream quality detection methods only focus on the qualities of the English Wikipedia articles, and usually analyze the text contents of articles, which is also a time-consuming process. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting the article qualities of the Chinese Wikipedia based on C4.5 decision tree. The problem of quality detection is transformed to classification problem of high-quality and low-quality articles. By using the fields from the tables in the Chinese Wikipedia database, we built the decision trees to distinguish high-quality articles from low-quality ones.",Wikipedia; Article quality; Data ming; Decision tree; Application of supervised learning,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39787-5_36,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39787-5_36,2,1,1,1,5,Yes,Yes
