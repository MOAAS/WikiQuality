<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This meter does not aim to assess accuracy of facts stated in Wikipedia articles, but instead measures quality using a Machine Learning approach that combines multiple predefined metrics. This model predicts quality with a mean error of 9%, worse on non-English articles, so these results are meant to be indicators of quality and are not to be taken as flawless ratings. Definitions of quality are based on Wikipedia's quality scale.
