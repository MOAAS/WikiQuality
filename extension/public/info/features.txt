The extension also summarizes the values of some features that are typically correlated with article quality. The thresholds were obtained from the feature values of the 25% and 50% percentiles of Featured Articles (<strong>25P</strong> and <strong>50P</strong>), and are respectively marked by orange and green separators. The results are color-coded as follows: 

<br> <strong style="color: var(--color-good)">Green:</strong> ≥ 50P
<br> <strong style="color: var(--color-medium)">Orange:</strong> ≥ 25P and < 50P
<br> <strong style="color: var(--color-bad)">Red:</strong> < 25P
