"'''Love Story'''" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. It was released on September 15, 2008, by [[Big Machine Records]], as the lead single from Swift's second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). Inspired by a love interest unpopular to Swift's family and friends, "Love Story" is based on the plot of [[William Shakespeare]]'s 16th-century tragedy ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. In the song's narrative, the two characters, [[Romeo]] and [[Juliet]], end up in a marriage proposal, contrary to Shakespeare's tragic conclusion. The lyrics additionally reference [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850). Produced by Swift and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], the [[country pop]] song features [[soprano]] vocals and a slow-building melody consisting of [[banjo]], [[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], and guitar.

After its initial release, "Love Story" received acclaim from critics, who admired its catchiness, production, and lyrics. Retrospectively, critics have considered it one of Swift's strongest singles, with some highlighting it as her signature song. The song peaked atop the chart in Australia, where it was [[List of music recording certifications|certified]] ten times platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). It reached the top five on charts in Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Scotland, and the U.K. In the U.S., "Love Story" peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified [[RIAA certification|eight times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). A success on [[pop radio]], "Love Story" was the first country song to top the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart. It has sold over six million copies in the U.S. and 18 millon copies worldwide.

[[Trey Fanjoy]] directed the accompanying [[music video]], which Swift conceived as a [[period piece]] that drew influences from the [[Medieval]], [[Renaissance]], and [[British Regency]] eras. It follows Swift and model [[Justin Gaston]] as they meet in a university campus and imagine themselves as lovers in a prior era. The video won Video of the Year at both the [[Country Music Association Awards]] and [[CMT Music Awards]] in 2009. Swift included "Love Story" on the set lists of all of her headlining tours: [[Fearless Tour|Fearless]] (2009–2010), [[Speak Now World Tour|Speak Now]] (2011–2012), [[the Red Tour|Red]] (2013–2014), [[the 1989 World Tour|1989]] (2015), and [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation]] (2018). The [[Re-recording (music)|re-recording]], "Love Story (Taylor's Version)", was released on February 12, 2021, through [[Republic Records]]. It topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, making Swift the second artist after [[Dolly Parton]] to reach number one with both the original and re-recorded versions of a song.

==Writing and inspiration==
"Love Story" came along late into the production of ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylors-time-catching-up-with-taylor-swift-20100125|title=Taylor's Time: Catching Up With Taylor Swift|date=January 25, 2010|access-date=February 1, 2010|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Austin|last=Scaggs|archive-date=August 13, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69sLygikq?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylors-time-catching-up-with-taylor-swift-20100125|url-status=live}}</ref> Swift wrote "Love Story" about a man who was never officially her [[boyfriend]].

She then centered the song on the line, which was ultimately placed in the "Love Story"'s second [[refrain]].<ref name="teenvogue">{{Cite web|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/blogs/music/2008/11/taylor-swift-exclusive-interview-with-teen-vogue.html#ixzz1DoAERAPo|title=Taylor Swift Responds!|first=Leigh|last=Bells|date=November 28, 2008|work=[[Teen Vogue]]|access-date=February 12, 2011|archive-date=February 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225214935/http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/blogs/music/2008/11/taylor-swift-exclusive-interview-with-teen-vogue.html#ixzz1DoAERAPo|url-status=live}}</ref> All events, with the exclusion of the end, narrated in the song regarded Swift's actual story. The song's conclusion differed from that of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. "I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other. And if that had just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it's a [[tragedy]]." Instead, she chose to write a [[happy ending]].<ref name="latimeswriting">{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/26/entertainment/ca-swift26|title=She's writing her future|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Randy|last=Lewis|date=October 26, 2008|access-date=February 12, 2011|archive-date=September 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913011046/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/26/entertainment/ca-swift26|url-status=live}}</ref> She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved.<ref name="cmtfairytale">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1599049/taylor-swifts-fascination-with-fairy-tales-comes-through-on-new-album.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift's fascination with Fairy Tales comes through on new album|first=Lindsey|last=Roznovsky|date=November 10, 2008|work=[[CMT News]]|access-date=February 13, 2011|archive-date=October 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020233804/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1599049/taylor-swifts-fascination-with-fairy-tales-comes-through-on-new-album.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for, including herself.<ref name="teenvogue" /> "You want a guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks, what anyone says." Although it was fictional, Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about.<ref name="cutbycut" /> Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes, feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished.<ref name="time" />

Swift and her love interest never did date. The failure of their relationship inspired another song on ''Fearless'', "[[White Horse (Taylor Swift song)|White Horse]]", which became the second single released from the album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/the-very-pink-very-perfect-life-of-taylor-swift-107451/|title=The Very Pink, Very Perfect Life of Taylor Swift|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Grigoriadis|first=Vanessa|date=March 5, 2009|access-date=February 21, 2021}}</ref> To Swift, "Love Story" resembles much [[optimism]] regarding love and how encountering the right person could surpass skepticism.<ref name="cmtfairytale" /> She deemed "Love Story" one of her most romantic songs, although she was never in an official relationship with the subject of the song.<ref name="time" /> In retrospect, Swift said the song is "about a love that you've got to hide because for whatever reason it wouldn't go over well", adding "I spun it in the direction of ''Romeo and Juliet''. Our parents are fighting. I relate to it more as a love that you cannot really elaborate on — a love that maybe society wouldn't accept [or] maybe your friends wouldn't accept."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,gac_26063_5937926,00.html|title="Oh, Romeo, Romeo": Taylor Swift's "Love Story"|date=September 15, 2008|work=[[Great American Country]]|publisher=[[Scripps Networks Interactive]]|access-date=February 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062628/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,gac_26063_5937926,00.html|archive-date=July 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Recording==
"Love Story" was recorded in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], alongside record producer [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]] and various personnel.<ref name="proaudio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.proaudioreview.com/article/21158|title=Taylor Swift — Love Story|first=Christopher|last=Walsh|date=March 17, 2009|work=ProAudio Review|publisher=The Wicks Group|access-date=February 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219201559/http://proaudioreview.com/article/21158|archive-date=December 19, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube [[microphone]], manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and [[audio engineer]] [[Ray Kennedy (country singer)|Ray Kennedy]] for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a "try this for a while" experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, he had not been able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from ''Taylor Swift'', she immediately grew fond of the microphone.<ref name="proaudio" /> "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," Chapman said.<ref name="proaudio" />

"Love Story" was recorded with [[Pro Tools]] and tracking vocals, which Swift sang live with the [[band (music)|band]]. The band consisted of [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[bass guitar]]s, and [[drumkit|drums]].<ref name="proaudio" /> All other instruments were [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] by Chapman. He said, "I think there are nine acoustic guitars on that track, and I stacked several [[background vocals]] — me singing, 'Ah's'."<ref name="proaudio" /> [[Audio engineering]] was executed by Chad Carlson in Blackbird Studios' Studio D, with the usage of the API Legacy Plus equipments: Avantone CV-12, Neve 1073, and Tube-Tech CL-1B. [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|Audio mixing]] done by Justin Niebank and was set in Studio F, with the usage of the console Solid State Logic 9080 K series and Genelec 1032 console. In between, overdubs were executed in Studio E by Chapman.<ref name="proaudio" /> "Love Story", along with the rest of the album, was [[audio mastering|mastered]] by Hank Williams at MasterMix Studios in Nashville, Tennessee.<ref name="liner">{{cite AV media notes |title=[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]|others=[[Taylor Swift]]|year=2008|type=CD|publisher=Big Machine Records|id=BMRATS0250}}</ref> The song was mixed for mainstream [[airplay]] by Chapman. He pulled Niebank's stems into his [[Mac OS]] laptop and used [[Apple Logic]] to create the pop version. Chapman made mix tweaks and created new elements with his laptop. In order to do so, he muted the country instruments and replaced them with new elements characteristic to [[pop music]], replacing [[banjo]] and [[fiddle]] with [[electric guitar]]. The pop version's opening beat is a Logic loop in the Ultrabeat beat generator. All the new electric guitars were done with the Amplitube Stomp I/O.<ref name="proaudio" />

Music scholar James E. Perone found the narrative formulaic and less dramatic than that of the original ''Romeo and Juliet'', but contended "the melodic hooks are strong enough to overcome the
predictability of the lyrics".{{sfn|Perone|2017|p=21}} In [[BBC Music]], Fraser McAlpine gave the single a four-out-of-five-stars rating. McAlpine deemed the Shakespearean reference unsuccessful and the lyrics generic, but praised the production and wrote: "it's great to see a big pop song being used as a method of direct story telling."<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2009/02/taylor_swift_love_story.shtml|title=Taylor Swift – 'Love Story'|first=Fraser|last=McAlpine|date=February 28, 2009|work=[[BBC Online]]|access-date=March 8, 2011|archive-date=November 7, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107085117/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2009/02/taylor_swift_love_story.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> In a mixed review, Jonathan Keefe of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' was impressed by Swift's melodic songwriting for creating "massive pop hooks", but found the literary references inexplicable and clumsy.

==Music video==
[[File:Taylor Swift - Love Story (music video screenshot).png|thumb|left|Swift and model [[Justin Gaston]] in a ballroom scene. Swift described the music video for "Love Story" as a [[period piece]] inspired by the [[Medieval]], [[Renaissance]], and [[Regency era|Regency]] eras.|alt=Swift and Justin Gaston in a ballroom]]
The accompanying [[music video]] for "Love Story" was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]], who had directed the music videos for the singles from ''Taylor Swift''. Swift collaborated with Fanjoy again because she had been able to balance both of their ideas.<ref name="onset">{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes at 'Love Story'|minutes=22:00|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=[[Great American Country]]}}</ref> For "Love Story", Swift conceived the video as a [[period piece]] drawing influences from the [[Medieval]], [[Renaissance]], and [[Regency era|Regency]] eras, aiming for a timeless narrative that "could happen in the 1700s, 1800s, or 2008".<ref name="cmtreplay">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/videos/misc/316863/video-replay-taylor-swift-love-story.jhtml|title=Video Replay: Taylor Swift – Love Story|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|publisher=Viacom|access-date=February 16, 2011|archive-date=November 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126095235/http://www.cmt.com/videos/misc/316863/video-replay-taylor-swift-love-story.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="onsetwhitehorse">{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes 'White Horse'|minutes=22:00|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=[[Great American Country]]}}</ref> For the male lead, with six months in advance, Swift searched by watching films for actors to interpret the role. An acquaintance of hers, who followed the sixth season of ''[[Nashville Star]]'', recommended contestant [[Justin Gaston]].<ref name="latimesgaston">{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2008/10/whos-that-romeo.html|title=Who's That Romeo in Taylor Swift's 'Love Story' Video?|first=Randy|last=Lewis|date=October 16, 2008|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=February 17, 2011|archive-date=February 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206194225/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2008/10/whos-that-romeo.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> After Gaston was eliminated from ''Nashville Star'', Swift contacted him to film the video.<ref name="onset" /> She believed Gaston was a perfect choice for the male lead, "I was so impressed by the way his [expressions] were in the video. Without even saying anything, he would just do a certain glance and it really came across well."<ref name="latimesgaston" />

The crew considered traveling to Europe to find a castle for the video's setting, but settled on Castle Gwynn in [[Arrington, Tennessee]]; Castle Gwynn was built in 1973 and is part of the annual Tennessee Renaissance Festival.<ref name="onset" /> Wardrobe for the video was supplied by Jacquard Fabrics, excluding Swift's dress for the balcony scene, which was designed by Sandi Spika with inspiration and suggestions from Swift.<ref name="onset" /><ref name="cmtreplay" /> The video was filmed in two days in August 2008 in Tennessee. On the first day, the balcony and field scenes were shot.<ref name="onset" /> On the second day, the video was filmed at [[Cumberland University]] in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]].<ref name="onset"/> Swift learned the choreography for the ballroom scene in fifteen minutes prior to filming. Approximately 20 dancers were used for the scene.<ref name="onset" />

The video commences with Swift, clothed in a black sweater and jeans, walking through a university campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in what seems to be an 18th-century castle, where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and sings on a balcony. Afterwards, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other young women. The two, along with others, engage in [[ballroom dancing]]. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Later on, Swift stands in the balcony again, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running towards her and she immediately runs down the castle's staircase to meet him. Swift and Gaston meet in the field right in front of the castle and hold each other. The video then transitions back into the modern-day college campus as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting.

===Video reception===
The video premiered on September 12, 2008, on [[Country Music Television|CMT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1594680/taylor-swift-premiering-new-video-on-cmt.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Premiering New Video on CMT|date=September 12, 2008|work=CMT News|publisher=Viacom|access-date=February 16, 2011|archive-date=June 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606231546/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1594680/taylor-swift-premiering-new-video-on-cmt.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> Mandi Bierly of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was concerned about the video marking Swift's artistic evolution because it seemed too expensive and made her wonder if anything else about Swift would change. However, she stated: "Worry though I might, I can’t resist Taylor Swift’s evolution from '[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]]' (2006) to her latest, 'Love Story'." Bierly also compared Swift's acting with that of [[Keira Knightley]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2008/09/17/taylor-swift-ju/|title=How much do you love Taylor Swift's 'Love Story' video?|first=Mandi|last=Bierly|date=September 17, 2008|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=February 17, 2011|archive-date=December 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205185640/http://popwatch.ew.com/2008/09/17/taylor-swift-ju/|url-status=live}}</ref> Fraser McAlpine of [[BBC Online]] believed Swift played a princess in the video and, therefore, said it would make females envious.<ref name="bbc" /> The video was nominated for the "Video of the Year" category at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards|45th Academy of Country Music Awards]], but lost to [[Brad Paisley]]'s "[[Waitin' on a Woman]]" (2008).<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.acmcountry.com/cms/upload/getMedia.php?mediaId=5512&attachment=true|title=Nominations announced for the 44th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards|publisher=[[Academy of Country Music]]|access-date=March 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311073142/http://www.acmcountry.com/cms/upload/getMedia.php?mediaId=5512&attachment=true|archive-date=March 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.acmcountry.com/cms/upload/getMedia.php?attachment=true&mediaId=6367|title=Winners announced for the 44th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards|publisher=[[Academy of Country Music]]|access-date=March 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707080611/http://www.acmcountry.com/cms/upload/getMedia.php?attachment=true&mediaId=6367|archive-date=July 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the 2009 [[CMT Music Awards]], the video won the CMT Music Awards for "Video of the Year" and "Female Video of the Year".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cmt-music-awards/2009/nominees.jhtml|title=2009 CMT Music Awards: Winners|work=CMT|publisher=Viacom|access-date=March 11, 2011|archive-date=December 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207221528/http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cmt-music-awards/2009/nominees.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> It also won the award for "Music Video of the Year" at the [[Country Music Association Awards|43rd Country Music Association Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cma/2009/nominees.jhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722133420/http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cma/2009/nominees.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 22, 2012|title=2009 CMA Awards: Winners|work=CMT|publisher=Viacom|access-date=March 11, 2011}}</ref> The video won "Favorite International Video" at the Philippine [[Myx Music Awards 2010]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myxph.com/features/1551/the-myx-music-awards-2010-winners/|title=The MYX Music Awards 2010 Winners|work=MYXph.com|publisher=[[MYX]]|access-date=March 11, 2011|archive-date=November 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114180551/http://www.myxph.com/features/1551/the-myx-music-awards-2010-winners/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Background and release===
{{See also|Taylor Swift masters controversy}}
In August 2019, Swift revealed her decision to re-record her first six studio albums after her [[master recording]]s were sold to American businessman [[Scooter Braun]] upon his purchase of her former record label, [[Big Machine Records]]. "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" was the first re-recorded track that Swift disclosed to the public when it was used as a [[jingle]] for a [[Match.com]] advertisement, written by actor [[Ryan Reynolds]], in December 2020.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Shaffer|first=Claire|date=2020-12-02|title=Taylor Swift Drops Her First Re-Recorded Song -- in an Ad for Match|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-re-recordings-ryan-reynolds-ad-1097553/|access-date=2021-02-12|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-date=February 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213005216/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-re-recordings-ryan-reynolds-ad-1097553/|url-status=live}}</ref> On February 11, 2021, on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' as well as via her social media accounts, Swift announced a re-recorded version of her second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'', titled ''[[Fearless (Taylor's Version)]]'', released on April 9, 2021.

On March 26, 2021, an electronic version of "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" remixed by Swedish producer Elvira was released.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=March 26, 2021|title=Taylor Swift Surprise Releases Dancefloor 'Elvira Remix' of 'Love Story'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9546873/taylor-swift-elvira-remix-love-story/|magazine=Billboard|access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref>

===Composition===
The re-recorded version remains faithful to the 2008 version, not departing from the original production. Many of the same musicians who played on the 2008 version of the instrumental were also involved in the re-recording.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Wood|first=Mikael|date=February 12, 2021|title=Taylor Swift's remade 'Love Story (Taylor's Version)' is still a classic, just now all hers|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2021-02-11/taylor-swift-love-story-remake|access-date=2021-02-12|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> However, there is a noticeable change in the [[timbre]] of Swift's vocals in the 2021 version, which has a "rounder and fuller" tone, free of much of her older country [[twang]]. It is re-recorded with higher precision, and a starker contrast between the instrumentals; the [[banjo]] strums, [[cymbal]]s, [[fiddle]], and violins in "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" are more prominent, with clearly defined [[Bass (sound)|bass]] instruments, stronger drums, less harsh electric guitars, and lowered harmonies in the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]].<ref name="BBC21">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56038367|title=Taylor Swift's two versions Love Story compared|first=Mark|last=Savage|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=February 12, 2021|access-date=February 12, 2021|archive-date=February 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213005241/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56038367|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Jagota|first=Vrinda|date=February 13, 2021|title=Taylor Swift – Love Story (Taylor's Version)|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/taylor-swift-love-story-taylors-version/|access-date=February 13, 2021|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite magazine|last=He|first=Richard|date=February 14, 2021|title=Taylor Swift's 'Love Story' Re-Recording Gently Reinvents a Modern Classic|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9525463/taylor-swift-love-story-rerecording-versions-compared|access-date=February 14, 2021|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic Simon Vozick-Levinson described "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" as a "brilliantly bittersweet update on a [[classic]]", equipped with more emotion, polished instrumentals, and vocal technique.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last1=Vozick-Levinson|first1=Simon|last2=Vozick-Levinson|first2=Simon|date=2021-02-12|title='Love Story (Taylor's Version)' Is a Brilliantly Bittersweet Update on a Classic|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/love-story-taylors-version-song-review-1127820/|access-date=2021-02-13|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' writer Vrinda Jagota praised Swift for her commitment to revisiting her teenage work without embarrassment, and branded it "an adult woman's display of ownership and agency".<ref name=":2" /> Mikael Wood of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' opined that "Love Story" remains a classic, noticing how the rerecorded version is "virtually indistinguishable" from its 2008 counterpart. While describing this similarity as somewhat a "disappointment" since Swift achieved artistic maturity with her 2020 albums ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'' and ''[[Evermore (Taylor Swift album)|Evermore]]'', Wood acknowledged that the rights to "Love Story" could completely belong to the singer, in doing so.<ref name=":1" />

Hannah Mylrea, writing for ''[[NME]]'', called it a "charming blast of nostalgia" with improved production, where Swift manages to preserve the "sparkle and warmth" that made "Love Story" a success. Mylrea added that Swift used her newly powerful vocals to channel her younger self in the 2021 version, whereas, the 2008 version had a more "earnest" tone to it.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mylrea|first=Hannah|date=February 12, 2021|title=Taylor Swift's re-recorded 'Love Story (Taylor's Version)' celebrates her 'Fearless' era|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/taylor-swifts-love-story-taylors-version-comparison-2878983|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213005242/https://www.nme.com/blogs/taylor-swifts-love-story-taylors-version-comparison-2878983|archive-date=February 13, 2021|access-date=February 12, 2021|website=[[NME]]}}</ref> Lauding Swift's vocal performance, ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Shirley Li wrote that the singer's voice at age 31 is "much richer", with a controlled tone and precise [[staccato]]. Li concluded that the 2008 version contained Swift's "eager, breathless vocals captured that thoroughly teenage sensation of fantasizing over a new crush", while the 2021 version "conjures a mature, amused wistfulness".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Li|first=Shirley|date=February 13, 2021|title=The Old Taylor Swift Never Left|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/02/taylor-swift-love-story-rerecording/618019/|access-date=February 13, 2021|website=[[The Atlantic]]}}</ref>

Richard S. He, reviewing for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', was impressed with the song's mixing. He wrote that the original was "a loud, dynamically flat mix and master designed to burst out of FM radio speakers", while the re-recorded version offers a well-balanced, lush, "impressive" mix that elevates the song's dreamy atmosphere. He also pointed out that the instruments in the original's chorus "seemed to blend into one big wall of sound", whereas "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" boasts an ambience with individual instruments.<ref name=":3" /> In his [[BBC]] review, Mark Savage wrote that the two versions were barely different, praising the "crisper" quality of "Love Story (Taylor's Version)", which allows the listeners to pick up instrumental details that were lost in the 2008 version. He highlighted that Swift's matured vocals and [[enunciation]] add depth and warmth to the song, while still capturing the "romantic innocence" of a teenager.<ref name="BBC21" /> [[Robert Christgau]] believed "Swift's voice retains a great deal of freshness", but questioned the value of her reproducing past songs, saying that he "can’t imagine even so that I'd lay out money for the re-recordings".<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=February 17, 2021|url=https://robertchristgau.substack.com/p/xgau-sez-february-2021|title=Xgau Sez: February, 2021|work=And It Don't Stop|publisher=[[Substack]]|access-date=April 17, 2021|url-access=subscription}}</ref> "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" is nominated for International Song of the Year at the 2021 [[British Country Music Association Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 28, 2021|title=2021 BCMA Awards Nominations|url=https://britishcma.co.uk/2021-bcma-awards-nominations/|access-date=September 28, 2021|website=britishcma.co.uk|publisher=[[British Country Music Association]]}}</ref>

With 25,000 sales and 13.7 million streams, "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" landed atop the US [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, giving Swift her eighth number-one single and first number-one debut on the chart; it marked her first chart-topper since "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]" (2012). She became the first artist to lead the chart in the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s, and the second artist in history to send both the original and re-recorded version of a song to the top spot, after [[Dolly Parton]] with "[[I Will Always Love You]]". Elsewhere, "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" topped [[Digital Song Sales]] (Swift's record-extending 22nd number one), [[Country Digital Song Sales]] (record-extending 15th number one), and Country Streaming Songs charts. The song debuted and peaked at number 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], marking her 129th entry on the chart—the most entries ever amongst women.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Taylor Swift's 'Love Story (Taylor's Version)' Debuts at No. 1 on Hot Country Songs Chart: 'I'm So Grateful to the Fans'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9529564/taylor-swift-love-story-number-one-hot-country-songs/|access-date=2021-02-22|magazine=Billboard|date=February 22, 2021}}</ref>

======================= ========== ==========================
======================= PLAIN TEXT ==========================
======================= ========== ==========================
"Love Story" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on September 15, 2008, by Big Machine Records, as the lead single from Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008). Inspired by a love interest unpopular to Swift's family and friends, "Love Story" is based on the plot of William Shakespeare's 16th-century tragedy Romeo and Juliet. In the song's narrative, the two characters, Romeo and Juliet, end up in a marriage proposal, contrary to Shakespeare's tragic conclusion. The lyrics additionally reference Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (1850). Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, the country pop song features soprano vocals and a slow-building melody consisting of banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and guitar.

After its initial release, "Love Story" received acclaim from critics, who admired its catchiness, production, and lyrics. Retrospectively, critics have considered it one of Swift's strongest singles, with some highlighting it as her signature song. The song peaked atop the chart in Australia, where it was certified ten times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). It reached the top five on charts in Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Scotland, and the U.K. In the U.S., "Love Story" peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A success on pop radio, "Love Story" was the first country song to top the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. It has sold over six million copies in the U.S. and 18 millon copies worldwide.

Trey Fanjoy directed the accompanying music video, which Swift conceived as a period piece that drew influences from the Medieval, Renaissance, and British Regency eras. It follows Swift and model Justin Gaston as they meet in a university campus and imagine themselves as lovers in a prior era. The video won Video of the Year at both the Country Music Association Awards and CMT Music Awards in 2009. Swift included "Love Story" on the set lists of all of her headlining tours: Fearless (2009–2010), Speak Now (2011–2012), Red (2013–2014), 1989 (2015), and Reputation (2018). The re-recording, "Love Story (Taylor's Version)", was released on February 12, 2021, through Republic Records. It topped Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, making Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to reach number one with both the original and re-recorded versions of a song.

Writing and inspiration
"Love Story" came along late into the production of Fearless. Swift wrote "Love Story" about a man who was never officially her boyfriend. When she introduced him to her family and friends, they did not become fond of him. "His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care", said Swift. Swift also felt like it was the first time she could relate to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597), one of her favorite narratives, which she described as, "The only people who wanted them to be together were them." She conceived the idea for the song when she reflected about the scenario: "I thought, 'This is difficult but it's real, it matters—it's not simple or easy but it's real'." She then centered the song on the line, which was ultimately placed in the "Love Story"'s second refrain. All events, with the exclusion of the end, narrated in the song regarded Swift's actual story. The song's conclusion differed from that of Romeo and Juliet. "I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other. And if that had just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it's a tragedy." Instead, she chose to write a happy ending. She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved. She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for, including herself. "You want a guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks, what anyone says." Although it was fictional, Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about. Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes, feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished.

Swift and her love interest never did date. The failure of their relationship inspired another song on Fearless, "White Horse", which became the second single released from the album. To Swift, "Love Story" resembles much optimism regarding love and how encountering the right person could surpass skepticism. She deemed "Love Story" one of her most romantic songs, although she was never in an official relationship with the subject of the song. In retrospect, Swift said the song is "about a love that you've got to hide because for whatever reason it wouldn't go over well", adding "I spun it in the direction of Romeo and Juliet. Our parents are fighting. I relate to it more as a love that you cannot really elaborate on — a love that maybe society wouldn't accept [or] maybe your friends wouldn't accept."

Recording
"Love Story" was recorded in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel. Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a "try this for a while" experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, he had not been able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," Chapman said.

"Love Story" was recorded with Pro Tools and tracking vocals, which Swift sang live with the band. The band consisted of acoustic guitars, bass guitars, and drums. All other instruments were overdubbed by Chapman. He said, "I think there are nine acoustic guitars on that track, and I stacked several background vocals — me singing, 'Ah's'." Audio engineering was executed by Chad Carlson in Blackbird Studios' Studio D, with the usage of the API Legacy Plus equipments: Avantone CV-12, Neve 1073, and Tube-Tech CL-1B. Audio mixing done by Justin Niebank and was set in Studio F, with the usage of the console Solid State Logic 9080 K series and Genelec 1032 console. In between, overdubs were executed in Studio E by Chapman. "Love Story", along with the rest of the album, was mastered by Hank Williams at MasterMix Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. The song was mixed for mainstream airplay by Chapman. He pulled Niebank's stems into his Mac OS laptop and used Apple Logic to create the pop version. Chapman made mix tweaks and created new elements with his laptop. In order to do so, he muted the country instruments and replaced them with new elements characteristic to pop music, replacing banjo and fiddle with electric guitar. The pop version's opening beat is a Logic loop in the Ultrabeat beat generator. All the new electric guitars were done with the Amplitube Stomp I/O.

Composition

"Love Story" is written by Swift and produced by Swift and Chapman. It is a country pop song with a length of three minutes and 54 seconds. The melody consists of banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and guitar. It is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of D major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from A3 to B4. Swift sings with a slight twang. It follows the chord progression D
(add)9–Asus4–Bm–G69. The song is of a swirling and dreamy soprano. The melody is simple, containing a rushy pace which continually grows and concludes with a key change to E major.

The lyrics of "Love Story" are written in first person, in which Swift refers to herself as the Romeo and Juliet character Juliet and her love interest as Romeo. In the narrative, Juliet's father is initially disapproval of their relationship. The first verse introduces the characters at a ball, where they meet. In the second verse, the story transitions to the couple sneaking about after dark and references Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (1850). The song's refrains have Swift waiting for her love interest to appear:  "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone/ I'll be waiting/ All there's left to do is run." The song's final refrain has Swift narrating from Romeo's perspective; Romeo has talked to Juliet's father and asks her to marry him.

Critical reception
In Fearless album reviews, Rob Sheffield from Blender and Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic selected "Love Story" as a standout. Deborah Evans Price of Billboard applauded the single for its "swirling, dreamy" production and emotional engagement that appealed to a broad audience. Writing for The Boston Globe, James Reed highlighted "Love Story" as an example of Swift's charm in her songwriting: "She knows how to write a hit." In USA Today, Elysa Gardner highlighted "Love Story" as an example of Swift's songwriting talents at such a young age: "It's a pleasure to hear a gifted teenager who sounds like a gifted teenager, rather than a mouthpiece for a bunch of older pros' collective notion of adolescent yearning."

Music scholar James E. Perone found the narrative formulaic and less dramatic than that of the original Romeo and Juliet, but contended "the melodic hooks are strong enough to overcome the
predictability of the lyrics". In BBC Music, Fraser McAlpine gave the single a four-out-of-five-stars rating. McAlpine deemed the Shakespearean reference unsuccessful and the lyrics generic, but praised the production and wrote: "it's great to see a big pop song being used as a method of direct story telling." In a mixed review, Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was impressed by Swift's melodic songwriting for creating "massive pop hooks", but found the literary references inexplicable and clumsy. Keefe deemed the lyrics overall lacking in creativity, and disapproved of Swift's "clipped phrasing" in the refrain.

"Love Story" featured on 2008 year-end lists by Blender at number 73 and The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop critics' poll at number 48. Taste of Country listed the song at number 17 on its 2016 list of greatest country songs of all time. In retrospective reviews, Hannah Mylrea from NME and Nate Jones from New York considered "Love Story" one of Swift's strongest songs in her entire discography. Alexis Petridis from The Guardian considered that with "Love Story", Swift's songwriting prowess first "fully revealed", and reflected on the literary references: "if the references to Shakespeare and Hawthorn seem clumsy, they are clumsy in a believably teenage way".

Commercial performance
"Love Story" debuted at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart dated September 27, 2008. The next week, it rose to number five. On the week ending January 17, 2009, the song reached its peak at number four. It remained on the Hot 100 for 49 weeks. "Love Story" peaked at number one on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart for two weeks. On Billboard's Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs) chart, the single reached number one on the week ending February 28, 2009; it was the first country crossover to top the chart. The song also reached number one on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart and number three on Billboard's Adult Pop Songs chart. It was the most successful song on US airplay, ranking number one on the year-end Radio Songs chart, of 2009. The single was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). By February 2021, "Love Story" had sold 6.13 million copies in the United States, becoming Swift's highest-selling single in the nation.

"Love Story" was Swift's first number-one single in Australia. The single was certified ten times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). It peaked within the top five of singles charts in Japan (three) and the English-speaking countries including the United Kingdom (two), Ireland (three), New Zealand (three), Canada (four), and Scotland (five). In mainland Europe, the track peaked at number ten on the European Hot 100 Singles chart, number four in the Czech Republic, number six in Hungary, number seven in Norway, and at number ten in Sweden. "Love Story" was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and Music Canada (MC), platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RMNZ), and gold by IFPI Danmark and the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). It was the sixth-best-selling single of 2009 worldwide, selling 6.5 million copies throughout the year. By February 2021, estimated worldwide sales of "Love Story" stood at 18 million.

Music video

The accompanying music video for "Love Story" was directed by Trey Fanjoy, who had directed the music videos for the singles from Taylor Swift. Swift collaborated with Fanjoy again because she had been able to balance both of their ideas. For "Love Story", Swift conceived the video as a period piece drawing influences from the Medieval, Renaissance, and Regency eras, aiming for a timeless narrative that "could happen in the 1700s, 1800s, or 2008". For the male lead, with six months in advance, Swift searched by watching films for actors to interpret the role. An acquaintance of hers, who followed the sixth season of Nashville Star, recommended contestant Justin Gaston. After Gaston was eliminated from Nashville Star, Swift contacted him to film the video. She believed Gaston was a perfect choice for the male lead, "I was so impressed by the way his [expressions] were in the video. Without even saying anything, he would just do a certain glance and it really came across well."

The crew considered traveling to Europe to find a castle for the video's setting, but settled on Castle Gwynn in Arrington, Tennessee; Castle Gwynn was built in 1973 and is part of the annual Tennessee Renaissance Festival. Wardrobe for the video was supplied by Jacquard Fabrics, excluding Swift's dress for the balcony scene, which was designed by Sandi Spika with inspiration and suggestions from Swift. The video was filmed in two days in August 2008 in Tennessee. On the first day, the balcony and field scenes were shot. On the second day, the video was filmed at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee. Swift learned the choreography for the ballroom scene in fifteen minutes prior to filming. Approximately 20 dancers were used for the scene.

The video commences with Swift, clothed in a black sweater and jeans, walking through a university campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in what seems to be an 18th-century castle, where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and sings on a balcony. Afterwards, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other young women. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Later on, Swift stands in the balcony again, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running towards her and she immediately runs down the castle's staircase to meet him. Swift and Gaston meet in the field right in front of the castle and hold each other. The video then transitions back into the modern-day college campus as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting.

Video reception
The video premiered on September 12, 2008, on CMT. Mandi Bierly of Entertainment Weekly was concerned about the video marking Swift's artistic evolution because it seemed too expensive and made her wonder if anything else about Swift would change. However, she stated: "Worry though I might, I can’t resist Taylor Swift’s evolution from 'Tim McGraw' (2006) to her latest, 'Love Story'." Bierly also compared Swift's acting with that of Keira Knightley. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Online believed Swift played a princess in the video and, therefore, said it would make females envious. The video was nominated for the "Video of the Year" category at the 45th Academy of Country Music Awards, but lost to Brad Paisley's "Waitin' on a Woman" (2008). At the 2009 CMT Music Awards, the video won the CMT Music Awards for "Video of the Year" and "Female Video of the Year". It also won the award for "Music Video of the Year" at the 43rd Country Music Association Awards. The video won "Favorite International Video" at the Philippine Myx Music Awards 2010.

Accolades

At the 35th People's Choice Awards, "Love Story" was nominated for the People's Choice Award for "Favorite Country", but lost to Carrie Underwood's "Last Name" (2008). The song was nominated for "Fave Song" at the Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards 2009, but lost to The Black Eyed Peas' "I Gotta Feeling" (2009) and received the same outcome at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards, when it lost the nomination for "Choice Music: Love Song" to David Archuleta's "Crush" (2008). In 2009, "Love Story" was declared the "Country Song of the Year" by Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI).

Live performances

When promoting the single in the United States in late 2008 and early 2009, Swift performed "Love Story" on the Good Morning America, the Late Show with David Letterman, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the 2008 Country Music Awards, as a duet with English rock band Def Leppard on CMT Crossroads, the episode was released as a DVD exclusively through Wal-Mart stores in the United States, Clear Channel Communications's Stripped, Studio 330 Sessions, and Saturday Night Live. In the United Kingdom, Swift promoted the track during early 2009 with performances on television programs, such as Loose Women and Later... with Jools Holland. Since, Swift has performed the track twice on The Today Show, at the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, the Australian charity concert Sydney Sound Relief, Dancing with the Stars, and again on the Late Show with David Letterman.

Swift performed "Love Story" on all venues of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to June 2010. The performances begun with backup dancers, dressed in Victorian era clothing, dancing ballroom to Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel's Canon, as a castle backdrop was projected onto the stage. Swift emerged to upper level of the stage, from below, donning a crimson, 18th century gown with a golden accents. For the song's last refrain, Swift hid behind backup dancers as she changed her wardrobe to a white wedding dress. Jon Pareles of The New York Times said Swift offered the audience with optimistic thinking with the performance in the August 27, 2009, concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Reviewing the May 22, 2010, concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Canada, Jane Stevenson of The Toronto Sun stated the moment was far too girly for her liking.

"Love Story" served as the final performance on the setlist of Swift's second concert tour, the Speak Now World Tour (2011); the performances featured Swift roaming throughout the stage, wearing a white sundress. On January 25, 2013, Swift did an acoustic version of the song, followed by "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" at the Los Premios 40 Principales in Spain. In 2014, Swift performed a new arena-rock rendition of "Love Story" during the 2014 iHeartRadio Music Festival. She performed the version again, transformed into a synth-pop ballad, at the 1989 World Tour.

The song was performed on Swift's fifth headlining tour, the Reputation Stadium Tour, as part of a medley alongside "Style" and "You Belong with Me". On April 23, 2019, she performed a piano rendition of the song at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts during the Time 100 Gala, where she was honored. On September 9, Swift performed the song at the City of Lover one-off concert in Paris, France. On November 24, she performed the song as part of a medley at the 2019 American Music Awards in Los Angeles.

"Love Story (Taylor's Version)"

Swift re-recorded "Love Story", subtitled "(Taylor's Version)", for her first re-recorded album, Fearless (Taylor's Version). It was released as the re-recorded album's lead single on February 12, 2021, through Republic Records. Music critics received "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" with positive reviews, highlighting Swift's mature vocals, the enhanced instrumentation and mixing, while remaining faithful to the original's emotion. The song peaked in the top 10 on charts of Canada, Ireland, Latvia, Malaysia, and Singapore. It was Swift's eighth number-one song on the US Hot Country Songs chart.

Background and release

In August 2019, Swift revealed her decision to re-record her first six studio albums after her master recordings were sold to American businessman Scooter Braun upon his purchase of her former record label, Big Machine Records. "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" was the first re-recorded track that Swift disclosed to the public when it was used as a jingle for a Match.com advertisement, written by actor Ryan Reynolds, in December 2020. On February 11, 2021, on Good Morning America as well as via her social media accounts, Swift announced a re-recorded version of her second studio album, Fearless, titled Fearless (Taylor's Version), released on April 9, 2021. "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" serves as the lead single from the re-recording.

A lyric video of "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" was released alongside the song. It features photographs of Swift with her fans, which Times of India dubbed as a move that replaces Romeo with the singer's fans. Rolling Stone shared the same viewpoint, stating that the video depicts "the love between artists and fans".

On March 26, 2021, an electronic version of "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" remixed by Swedish producer Elvira was released.

Composition
The re-recorded version remains faithful to the 2008 version, not departing from the original production. Many of the same musicians who played on the 2008 version of the instrumental were also involved in the re-recording. However, there is a noticeable change in the timbre of Swift's vocals in the 2021 version, which has a "rounder and fuller" tone, free of much of her older country twang. It is re-recorded with higher precision, and a starker contrast between the instrumentals; the banjo strums, cymbals, fiddle, and violins in "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" are more prominent, with clearly defined bass instruments, stronger drums, less harsh electric guitars, and lowered harmonies in the mix.

Critical reception
Rolling Stone critic Simon Vozick-Levinson described "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" as a "brilliantly bittersweet update on a classic", equipped with more emotion, polished instrumentals, and vocal technique. Pitchfork writer Vrinda Jagota praised Swift for her commitment to revisiting her teenage work without embarrassment, and branded it "an adult woman's display of ownership and agency". Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times opined that "Love Story" remains a classic, noticing how the rerecorded version is "virtually indistinguishable" from its 2008 counterpart. While describing this similarity as somewhat a "disappointment" since Swift achieved artistic maturity with her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Wood acknowledged that the rights to "Love Story" could completely belong to the singer, in doing so.

Hannah Mylrea, writing for NME, called it a "charming blast of nostalgia" with improved production, where Swift manages to preserve the "sparkle and warmth" that made "Love Story" a success. Mylrea added that Swift used her newly powerful vocals to channel her younger self in the 2021 version, whereas, the 2008 version had a more "earnest" tone to it. Lauding Swift's vocal performance, The Atlantic's Shirley Li wrote that the singer's voice at age 31 is "much richer", with a controlled tone and precise staccato. Li concluded that the 2008 version contained Swift's "eager, breathless vocals captured that thoroughly teenage sensation of fantasizing over a new crush", while the 2021 version "conjures a mature, amused wistfulness".

Richard S. He, reviewing for Billboard, was impressed with the song's mixing. He wrote that the original was "a loud, dynamically flat mix and master designed to burst out of FM radio speakers", while the re-recorded version offers a well-balanced, lush, "impressive" mix that elevates the song's dreamy atmosphere. He also pointed out that the instruments in the original's chorus "seemed to blend into one big wall of sound", whereas "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" boasts an ambience with individual instruments. In his BBC review, Mark Savage wrote that the two versions were barely different, praising the "crisper" quality of "Love Story (Taylor's Version)", which allows the listeners to pick up instrumental details that were lost in the 2008 version. He highlighted that Swift's matured vocals and enunciation add depth and warmth to the song, while still capturing the "romantic innocence" of a teenager. Robert Christgau believed "Swift's voice retains a great deal of freshness", but questioned the value of her reproducing past songs, saying that he "can’t imagine even so that I'd lay out money for the re-recordings". "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" is nominated for International Song of the Year at the 2021 British Country Music Association Awards.

Commercial performance
In the United States, "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" sold 10,000 digital downloads and garnered 5.8 million on-demand streams in its first day of release. While not actively promoted to radio, the version drew 144 plays across 89 radio stations for a total of 777,000 audience impressions.

With 25,000 sales and 13.7 million streams, "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" landed atop the US Hot Country Songs chart, giving Swift her eighth number-one single and first number-one debut on the chart; it marked her first chart-topper since "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" (2012). She became the first artist to lead the chart in the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s, and the second artist in history to send both the original and re-recorded version of a song to the top spot, after Dolly Parton with "I Will Always Love You". Elsewhere, "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" topped Digital Song Sales (Swift's record-extending 22nd number one), Country Digital Song Sales (record-extending 15th number one), and Country Streaming Songs charts. The song debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking her 129th entry on the chart—the most entries ever amongst women.
