## Content Features

Content features analyze the length and structure of the article. All of them can be directly obtained from the plain text and original wikitext, so they are the fastest to
compute.

## Style Features

Style features evaluate how contributors write their sentences, measuring the used word classes and sentence types. They can all be derived from the articleâ€™s plain text.

## Network Features

Network features consider Wikipedia as a graph, where its nodes represent articles and the edges are the citations between them.
