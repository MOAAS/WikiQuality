==Early life and family==
Cage was born in [[Long Beach, California]], to [[August Coppola]], a professor of literature, and Joy Vogelsang, a dancer and choreographer. He was raised in a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of German and Polish ancestry.<ref name="MSQa6" /><ref name="fennell" /><ref name="pexNq" /> His paternal grandparents were composer [[Carmine Coppola]] and actress [[Italia Pennino]], and his paternal great-grandparents were immigrants from [[Bernalda]], [[Basilicata]].<ref name="cowie" /> Through his father, he is a nephew of director [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and of actress [[Talia Shire]], and a cousin of directors [[Roman Coppola]] and [[Sofia Coppola]], film producer [[Gian-Carlo Coppola]], and actors [[Robert Schwartzman|Robert]] and [[Jason Schwartzman]].<ref name="Bkxdm" /><ref name="XRDiv" />

Cage's two brothers are New York radio personality [[Marc Coppola (actor)|Marc "The Cope" Coppola]] and director [[Christopher Coppola]]. He attended [[Beverly Hills High School]],<ref name="6f4NO" /> which is known for its many alumni who became entertainers. He aspired to act from an early age and also attended [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. His first non-cinematic acting experience was in a school production of ''[[Golden Boy (play)|Golden Boy]]''.<ref name="VloOK" /> He said he started acting because he "wanted to be [[James Dean]]. I saw him in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]''. Nothing affected me—no rock song, no classical music—the way Dean affected me in ''Eden''. It blew my mind. I was like, 'That's what I want to do'."<ref name="Qpcsl" />

At fifteen years old he tried to convince his uncle, Francis Ford Coppola, to give him a [[screen test]], telling him "I'll show you acting." His outburst was met with "silence in the car".<ref name="Ch7cf" /> By this stage of his career, Coppola had already directed [[Marlon Brando]], [[Al Pacino]], [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Robert De Niro]]. Although early in his career he appeared in some of his uncle's films, he changed his name to Nicholas Cage to avoid the appearance of [[nepotism]] as Coppola's nephew and was inspired, in part, by the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Luke Cage]] and composer [[John Cage]].<ref name="nytimes-1996">{{cite news|title=Nicholas Cage, The Sunshine Man|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/movies/film-nicholas-cage-the-sunshine-man.html|author=Ellen Pall|date=1994-07-24|access-date=2022-03-21|archive-date=2021-01-06|work=The New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126164143/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/movies/film-nicholas-cage-the-sunshine-man.html}}</ref><ref name="bio" />

==Career==
===Acting===
{{further|Nicolas Cage filmography}}
Since his film debut with a minor role in ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' (1982), opposite [[Judge Reinhold]] and [[Sean Penn]], and an early starring role in 1983's ''[[Valley Girl (1983 film)|Valley Girl]]'', directed by [[Martha Coolidge]], Cage has appeared in a wide range of films, both mainstream and offbeat.<ref name="bio" /> He auditioned for the role of Dallas Winston in his uncle's film ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'', based on [[S.E. Hinton]]'s [[The Outsiders (novel)|novel]], but lost to [[Matt Dillon]].<ref name="yv5r9" /> He was also in Coppola's films ''[[Rumble Fish]]''<ref name="s9u79" /> and ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]].''<ref name="d4cjN" />

Other Cage roles included appearances in the acclaimed 1987 romantic-comedy film ''[[Moonstruck]]'', also starring [[Cher]];<ref name="bio" /> the [[Coen Brothers]] cult-classic comedy ''[[Raising Arizona]]'';<ref name="bio" /> [[David Lynch]]'s 1990 film ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'';<ref name="bio" /> [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1999 New York City paramedic drama ''[[Bringing Out the Dead]]'';<ref name="bio" /> and [[Ridley Scott]]'s 2003 black comedy crime film ''[[Matchstick Men]]'', in which he played a con artist with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]].<ref name="oJaCk" />

Cage has been nominated twice for an [[Academy Award]], winning once for his performance as a suicidal alcoholic in ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]''.<ref name="bio" /> His other nomination was for his portrayal of real-life screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]] and Kaufman's fictional twin Donald in ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]''<ref name="zs0yv" /> Despite these successes, most of his lower-profile films have performed poorly at the box office compared to his mainstream action/adventure roles. The suspense thriller ''[[8mm (film)|8mm]]'' (1999) is considered a cult film.<ref name="8P8Wo" /> He took the lead role in the 2001 film ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin (film)|Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]'' and learned to play the mandolin from scratch for the part.<ref name="VzuSC" /><ref name="qPv3D" /> He made his directorial debut with 2002's ''[[Sonny (film)|Sonny]]''. In 2005, two films he headlined, ''[[Lord of War]]'' and ''[[The Weather Man]]'',<ref name="JkCMP" /> failed to find a significant audience despite nationwide releases and good reviews for his performances.<ref name="yUV67" />

The 2006 remake of ''[[The Wicker Man (2006 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' was very poorly reviewed, and failed to make back its $40 million budget.<ref name="9dwnq" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://substreammagazine.com/2016/09/wicker-man-throwback/|title='The Wicker Man' remake is just as ridiculous even 10 years later|last=Monson|first=Leigh|date=2016-09-01|website=Substream Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-25|archive-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225125914/https://substreammagazine.com/2016/09/wicker-man-throwback/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The much-criticized ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' (2007), based on the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Marvel Comics character]], fared better, earning more than $45&nbsp;million (the top earner) during its opening weekend and over $208&nbsp;million worldwide through the weekend ending on March 25, 2007.<ref name="r114G" /> Also in 2007, he starred in ''[[Next (2007 film)|Next]]'', which shared the concept of a glimpse into an alternate timeline with Cage's film,<ref name="N05jH" /> ''[[The Family Man]]'' (2000).<ref name="Nu4Bc" />

[[File:Nicolas Cage - 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra).jpg|thumb|upright|Cage at the [[2009 Venice International Film Festival]]]]

Most of Cage's movies that have achieved financial success were in the action/adventure genre. In his second-highest-grossing film to date, ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]'', he plays an eccentric historian who goes on a dangerous adventure to find treasure hidden by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].<ref name="8PQYU" /> Other action hits include ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'', in which Cage plays a young FBI chemical weapons expert who infiltrates [[Alcatraz Island]] in the hope of neutralizing a terrorist threat,<ref name="ROSLb" /> ''[[Face/Off]]'', a [[John Woo]] film where he plays both a hero and a villain,<ref name="IIr4O" /> and ''[[World Trade Center (film)|World Trade Center]]'', director [[Oliver Stone]]'s film about the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name="4NdD3" /> He had a small but notable role as the Chinese criminal mastermind [[Dr. Fu Manchu]] in [[Rob Zombie]]'s fake trailer ''Werewolf Women of the S.S.'' from the [[B movie|B-movie]] [[double feature]] ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''.<ref name="SW6ey" />

In November 2007, Cage was spotted backstage at a ''[[Ring of Honor]]'' wrestling show in New York City researching for the lead role for ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]''. However, Cage dropped out of production shortly afterward because he felt that he did not have enough time to prepare for the role and director [[Darren Aronofsky]] preferred [[Mickey Rourke]] for the lead role. Rourke would go on to receive an Academy Award nomination for his performance.<ref name="sescoops" /><ref name="283M0" /> In an interview with /Film, Aronofsky said of Cage's decision to leave the film that "Nic was a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but ... you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race."<ref name="slash" />

In 2008, Cage appeared as Joe, a contract killer who undergoes a change of heart while on a work outing in Bangkok, in the film ''[[Bangkok Dangerous (2008 film)|Bangkok Dangerous]]''. The film is shot by the [[Pang Brothers]] and has a distinctly South-East Asian flavor.<ref name="NWfpj" /> In 2009, Cage starred in the science fiction thriller ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'', directed by [[Alex Proyas]]. In the film, he plays an [[MIT]] professor who examines the contents of a time capsule unearthed at his son's elementary school. Startling predictions found inside the capsule that has already come true lead him to believe that the world is going to end at the close of the week and that he and his son are somehow involved in the destruction.<ref name="UAzWN" /> The film received mainly negative reviews but was the box office winner on its opening weekend.<ref name="aofOf" />

Also in 2009, Cage starred in the film ''[[Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans]]'', directed by acclaimed German director [[Werner Herzog]].<ref name="4qCph" /> He portrayed a corrupt police officer with gambling, drug and alcohol addictions. The film was very well received by critics, holding a rating of 87% positive reviews on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref name="tomato" /> Cage was lauded for his performance, with [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' writing "Herzog has found his ideal interpreter, a performer whose truth lies deep in the artifice of performance: ladies and gentlemen, Nicolas Cage, at his finest."<ref name="chitribune" /> This film reunited Cage with [[Eva Mendes]], who played his love interest in ''Ghost Rider''.<ref name="e2WRU" /> In 2010, Cage starred in ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010 film)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'', in which he played the sorcerer, and the next year, headlined the period piece ''[[Season of the Witch (2011 film)|Season of the Witch]]'', as a 14th-century knight transporting a woman accused of causing the [[Black Plague]] to a monastery.<ref name="sorcerer" />

[[File:Nicolas Cage 2011 CC.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cage at the 2011 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]

In 2012, Cage reprised his role in ''Ghost Rider's'' sequel ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]].''<ref name="WzgFX" /> He voiced the character Grug Crood in the animated film ''The Croods'', which was released in 2013. ''The Croods'' received positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $585&nbsp;million against a budget of $135&nbsp;million.<ref name="Lp7Gx" /> In the same year he starred as main character in ''[[The Frozen Ground]]'', a [[Thriller film|thriller]] [[Crime film|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] film directed and written by Scott Walker in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], based on the crimes of real-life Alaskan [[serial killer]] [[Robert Hansen]]:<ref name="THRILL" /> The film depicts an Alaskan State Trooper, played by Cage, seeking to apprehend Hansen by partnering with a young woman, who escaped from Hansen's clutches. The film has received mixed reviews though Cage's performance was cited as a highlight and solid.<ref name="rottentomatoes" /><ref name="metacritic" />

In 2013 he also starred in ''[[Joe (2013 film)|Joe]]'', an [[Independent film|independent]] [[crime film|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed and co-produced by [[David Gordon Green]], adaptation from [[Larry Brown (author)|Larry Brown]]'s 1991 novel of the same name. In this film Nicolas Cage is a tormented man who hires a 15-year-old boy (played by [[Tye Sheridan]]) and protects him from his abusive father. The film premiered at the [[70th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 30, 2013,<ref name="ucBTb" /><ref name="b1GG8" /> with a subsequent screening at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name="TIFF2013" /> It was a [[Box office bomb|box office flop]], grossing only $2.36&nbsp;million from a $4&nbsp;million budget, but received critical acclaim from critics, who praised Cage's performance and Green's direction.

The 2016 black comedy ''[[Dog Eat Dog (2016 film)|Dog Eat Dog]]'', Cage's second film with [[Paul Schrader]], reunited him with [[Willem Dafoe]] (after ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'') as a pair of ex-convicts hired to kidnap a baby.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Debruge |first1=Peter |title=Cannes Film Review: 'Dog Eat Dog' |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/dog-eat-dog-review-cannes-1201779495/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=June 25, 2018 |date=May 20, 2016}}</ref> The film had its premiere as the closing entry for the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 20, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/05/dog-eat-dog-willem-dafoe-video-paul-schrader-1201755927/|title=Willem Dafoe's Loose Cannon Crook in Paul Schrader's 'Dog Eat Dog' – Cannes Video|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first= Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=May 14, 2016|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref> It was released on November 4, 2016 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2016/09/dog-eat-dog-trailer-nicolas-cage-willem-dafoe-paul-schrader-2-1201730596/|title='Dog Eat Dog' Trailer: Nicolas Cage and Willem Dafoe Go Wild In Paul Schrader's Crazy Heist Thriller—Watch|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Kate|last=Erbland|date=September 26, 2016|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref> [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing, "It's the right director for the right project and the result is Schrader's best for years: a lairy, nasty, tasty crime thriller built on black-comic chaos."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/20/dog-eat-dog-review-willem-dafoe-paul-schrader-ed-bunker-cannes|title=Dog Eat Dog review – Willem Dafoe is magnificently needy in Paul Schrader's tasty thriller|website=[[The Guardian]]|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=May 20, 2016|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref> [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, "A rare film to have been shot in Cleveland, ''Dog Eat Dog'' definitely looks like it was shot on the cheap but puts what it needs to up on the screen with vigor and wit."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dog-eat-dog-cannes-review-896012/|title='Dog Eat Dog': Cannes Review|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|date=May 20, 2016|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref>

===Producing and directing===
Cage made his directorial debut in 2002 with ''[[Sonny (2002 film)|Sonny]]'', a low-budget drama starring [[James Franco]] as a male prostitute whose mother ([[Brenda Blethyn]]) serves as his pimp. Cage had a small role in the film, which received poor reviews and a short run in a limited number of theaters.<ref name="bio" /><ref name="PlstF" /> Cage's producing career includes ''[[Shadow of the Vampire]]'', the first effort from Saturn Films.<ref name="NunAn" />

In early December 2006, Cage announced at the Bahamas International Film Festival that he planned to curtail his future acting endeavors to pursue other interests. On ''[[The Dresden Files (TV series)|The Dresden Files]]'' for the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]], Cage is listed as the executive producer.<ref name="oCe8A" />

===Other work===
Cage, an avid comic book fan, auctioned a collection of 400 vintage comics through [[Heritage Auctions]] for over $1.6&nbsp;million in 2002.<ref name="susman" /> In 2007, he created a comic book with his son Weston, called ''[[Voodoo Child (comics)|Voodoo Child]]'', which was published by [[Virgin Comics]].<ref name="MGsBx" />

==Reception and acting style==
{{quote box
| quote = "In Cage's hands, cartoonish moments are imbued with real emotion and real emotions become cartoons. Everything – from individual scenes down to single lines of dialogue – feel like they have been embraced as opportunities for creation. Cage is usually interesting even when his films are not. He is erratic and unpredictable; he is captivating and he is capricious. He is a performer. He is a troubadour. He is a jazz musician."

In February 2011, Cage said that, at a certain point in his career, he realized that he had developed his own method of acting, which he described as "Nouveau Shamanic." He noted, "at some point I'll have to write a book" about it.<ref name="RSxhk" /> Cage later explained that he drew the inspiration for the name from the book ''The Way of the Actor'' by Brian Bates<!-- Cage says the book was "The Way of Wyrd", also by Bates, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwWFd_9fUYM -->, in which he read about the parallel between the ancient [[shamans]] and thespians.<ref name="h4JvB" /> In other interviews, Cage defined his acting style using terms such as [[German Expressionism]]<ref>{{cite AV media

 | date =1999
 | title =Vampire's Kiss
 | medium =Motion picture
 | time =9:35–45
 | quote =I guess in my own mind I [Nicholas Cage] had this idea that there could be a new expression in acting. I was weaned, oddly enough, on vampire—German expressionism films like [[Nosferatu]] and [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]], and I wanted to be able to use that kind of silent film style of acting}}</ref> or "Western [[kabuki]]".<ref name="ID9EH" />

On some occasions, Cage stood up for his extreme [[method acting]]. For ''Birdy'', in order to physically feel the pain of his character (a veteran from [[Vietnam War]]), Cage removed two teeth, which have had to be pulled anyway, without any anesthesia.<ref>{{Citation |title=Nicolas Cage Replies to Fans on the Internet {{!}} Actually Me {{!}} GQ |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwWFd_9fUYM |language=en |access-date=2022-03-31}}</ref> He also spent five weeks with his face wrapped in bandages, receiving brutal reactions by various people for his aspect.

''Vampire's Kiss''' casting director Marcia Shulman declared that Cage asked to have hot yogurt poured over his toes to get excited during a love scene with [[Jennifer Beals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theplaylist.net/nicolas-cage-vampires-kiss-filming-20190621/|title=Nicolas Cage Required Hot Yogurt On His Toes To Enjoy A Love Scene With Jennifer Beals During 'Vampire's Kiss'|first=Alex David|last=Lynch|date=June 21, 2019|work=The Playlist}}</ref> He also studied [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] under the [[UFC]] champion [[Royce Gracie]], for his roles in action films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://martialartsactionmovies.com/the-ultimate-list-celebrity-black-belts-martial-artists/|title=The Ultimate List: Celebrity Black Belts & Martial Artists|website=Martial Arts & Action Movies|date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> During an interview of 2013 for promoting ''Joe'', Cage revealed that he followed a diet based on [[red meat]] and [[steaks]] to gain weight for the role and to identify himself as a carnivore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.film.it/cinema/venezia-70/dettaglio/art/esclusivo-nicolas-cage-domatore-di-serpenti-38801/|title=Esclusivo: Nicolas Cage, domatore di serpenti|website=Film.it|language=it|date=2013-09-02}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' film critic Luke Buckmaster, "any casual observer can see that Cage is entertaining, charismatic and wildly flamboyant". Attributing it partly to the "well-cultured" background of Cage's family, Buckmaster said the actor "is clearly attracted to grotesque characters and is celebrated for his wild and unhinged approach to them. He has the presence of a leading man, and the eccentricities of a character actor." Actor [[Ethan Hawke]] stated in 2013 that Cage is "the only actor since [[Marlon Brando]] that's actually done anything new with the art", crediting him for taking film audiences "away from an obsession with [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fq1h6/i_am_ethan_hawke_amaa/cacojck/|author-link=Ethan Hawke|first=Ethan|last=Hawke|title=I Am Ethan Hawke – AMAA|agency=[[Reddit]]|date=June 5, 2013|access-date=July 19, 2021}}</ref>

Film director [[David Lynch]] described him as "the jazz musician of American acting".<ref name="Buckmaster" /> Many critics have accused Cage of [[overacting]].<ref name="Buckmaster" /> Others, including Cage himself, have described his intentionally extreme performances as "mega-acting".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10155965/The-wonderfully-mad-world-of-Nicolas-Cage.html |title=The wonderfully mad world of Nicolas Cage |last=Billson |first=Anne |date=July 3, 2013 |website=The Telegraph|access-date= March 14, 2019 |quote=Cage's mega-acting can be a marvellous thing to behold: the bug-eyes, the yelling, the Mick Jagger poses, the Oscar-winning lugubriousness.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2017-01-31/nicolas-cage-takes-over-the-alamo/ |title=Nicolas Cage Takes Over the Alamo: Watch the mega-acting star perform Edgar Allan Poe |last=Whittaker |first=Richard |date= January 31, 2017 |website=Austin Chronicle |access-date= March 14, 2019 |quote=Yet what came out most was how Cage, whose reputation is for what has been dubbed mega-acting, takes his work incredibly seriously.}}</ref> After the actor's series of mainstream-marketed thriller films during the late 1990s, [[Sean Penn]] told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1999 that Cage was "no longer an actor" but "more like a performer".<ref name="6qg2h" /> Despite this, in his speech after winning the Oscar for his performance in ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'', Penn described Cage's work (in ''[[Matchstick Men]]'') as one of the best performances of 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/076-1/ |title=Oscar acceptance speech of Sean Penn |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=February 29, 2004 |access-date=May 14, 2014}}</ref>

During the 2010s, a growing number of film critics have described Cage as one of the most underrated actors of his generation.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://spectrumculture.com/2013/10/16/criminally-underrated-nicolas-cage/|title=Criminally Underrated: Nicolas Cage|magazine=Spectrum Culture|first=Alex|last=Peterson|date=October 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/in-defence-nicolas-cage-2265796|title=In defence of Nicolas Cage|work=[[NME]]|first=Alex|last=Flood|date=March 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.screengeek.net/2018/01/07/why-nicolas-cage-is-secretly-the-greatest-actor-ever/|title=Why Nicolas Cage Is Secretly The Greatest Actor Ever|publisher=ScreenGeek.net|first=Frank|last=Palmer|date=January 7, 2018}}</ref>

In July 2021, Cage told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that the commercial constraints that were imposed on his performances was the main reason he abandoned Hollywood and that he opted to work for low-budget independent films because it gave him more freedom to experiment and be fluid.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2021/film/features/nicolas-cage-pig-hollywood-stardom-jerry-bruckheimer-1235020281/|title='Pig' Star Nicolas Cage on Abandoning Hollywood: 'I've Gone Into My Own Wilderness'|magazine=Variety|first=Brent|last=Lang|date=July 15, 2021|access-date=July 18, 2021}}</ref>

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
In 1988, Cage began dating actress [[Christina Fulton]], with whom he had a son, Weston Coppola Cage (born December 26, 1990). Weston has been involved in two [[black metal]] bands, and appeared in his father's film ''Lord of War'' as a helicopter mechanic. Through Weston, Cage has two grandsons born in 2014 and 2016.<ref name="O9Xpe" />

Cage has been married five times. His first wife was actress [[Patricia Arquette]] (married in April 1995, divorce finalized in 2001).<ref name="xIsd8" />

Cage's second marriage was to singer and songwriter [[Lisa Marie Presley]], daughter of [[Elvis Presley]]. Cage is an Elvis fan and used the star as the base of his performance in ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]''. Presley and Cage married on August 10, 2002, and filed for divorce 107 days later on November 25, 2002. The divorce was finalized on May 16, 2004.<ref name="silverman2004" />

===Political and religious views===
Cage grew up in a family of Catholic background, but does not talk about religion publicly and refuses to answer religion-connected questions in his interviews.<ref name="fennell" /> When asked about the film ''Knowing'' being a religion-themed film or not, Cage replied, "Any of my personal beliefs or opinions runs the risk of impinging on your own relationship with the movie. I feel movies are best left enigmatic, left raising more questions than answers. I don't want to ever preach. So [whatever you get] from the movie [is] far more interesting than [anything] I could ever offer."<ref name="0MTDg" />

During his visit to [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] he stated that he is not a politically active actor and that he can do it in his work as he learned "more about [[nuclear power]] from the movie ''[[The China Syndrome]]''".<ref name="obP9C" /> Cage endorsed [[Andrew Yang]] for president during the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Bort |first1=Ryan |title=What Is Going on With Andrew Yang's Candidacy? |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/yang-gang-explained-810872/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=June 11, 2019 |date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>

===Charitable activities===
Cage has been called one of the most generous stars in Hollywood.<ref name="rop7c" /> He donated $2&nbsp;million to [[Amnesty International]] for them to use to offer rehabilitation shelters, medical services and psychological and reintegration services to some of the 300,000 children forced to fight in conflicts across the world.<ref name="nAazS" /> He has also donated $1&nbsp;million to the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name="MTigW" /> He became the first artist to support ArtWorks, an artist engagement program to raise awareness of fundamental rights at work, including freedom from slavery and from child labor.<ref name="Qe1kc" />

Cage has also been honored with a Humanitarian award from United Nations for his works and appointed as a UN ambassador for Global Justice in 2009 and again in 2013.<ref name="p9yRD" /> He led a campaign around the film ''Lord of War'' to raise awareness about international arms control, supported "Heal the Bay," the [[United Negro College Fund]] efforts, and the [[Royal United Hospital]]'s Forever Friends Appeal to build intensive care units for babies.<ref name="hHMga" /><ref name="qLGcT" />

===Real estate and tax problems===

[[Image:Neidstein Schloss1.jpg|thumb|[[Schloss Neidstein]] in [[Bavaria]] was owned by Cage between 2007 and 2009.]]
Nicolas Cage was once considered one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, earning $40&nbsp;million in 2009 according to ''[[Forbes]]'', although he failed to make Forbes' Top 10 List in 2014.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="94xP0" /> Cage had a [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home where he and Kim lived, but sold the property in 2005 for $10&nbsp;million. In 2004 he bought a property on [[Paradise Island]], Bahamas. In May 2006, he bought a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} island in the [[Exuma]] archipelago, some {{convert|85|mi|km}} southeast of [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and close to a similar island owned by [[Faith Hill]] and [[Tim McGraw]].<ref name="iFec3" /> He bought the medieval castle [[Schloss Neidstein]] in the [[Oberpfalz]] region in Germany in 2006 and sold it in 2009 for $2.5&nbsp;million. His grandmother was German, living in [[Cochem|Cochem an der Mosel]].<ref name="zeitung" />

In August 2007, Cage purchased "Grey Craig," a {{convert|24000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} brick-and-stone country manor in [[Middletown, Rhode Island]]. With an estate occupying {{convert|26|acre|ha}}, the home has 12 bedrooms and 10 full bathrooms and overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. It borders the [[Norman Bird Sanctuary]] to the west. The sale ranked among the state of Rhode Island's most expensive residential purchases.<ref name="uZ1i6" /><ref name="2oA6n" /> Also in 2007, Cage purchased [[Midford Castle]] in Somerset, England.<ref name="hodgson" /><ref name="chittenden" /> Shortly after selling his German castle, Cage also put his homes in Rhode Island, [[Louisiana]], [[Nevada]], and California, as well as a $7&nbsp;million island in the [[Bahamas]], on the market.<ref name="ZYHIk" />

On July 14, 2009, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] filed documents in New Orleans in connection with a [[tax lien|federal tax lien]] against property owned by Cage in Louisiana, concerning unpaid federal taxes. The IRS alleges that Cage failed to pay over $6.2&nbsp;million in federal income tax for the year 2007.<ref name="houstonchronicle" /> In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has another lien for more than $350,000 in unpaid taxes dating from 2002 to 2004.<ref name="rodriguez" /> Cage filed a $20&nbsp;million lawsuit on October 16, 2009, against his business manager, Samuel J. Levin, alleging negligence and fraud.<ref name="ruin" /> The lawsuit states that Levin "had failed to pay taxes when they were due and had placed [Cage] in speculative and risky real estate investments 'resulting in (the actor) suffering catastrophic losses.{{'"}}<ref name="ruin" /> Cage is also facing separate lawsuits from [[East West Bank]]<ref name="indiatimes" /> and Red Curb Investments for unpaid, multi-million dollar loans.

[[Image:1140 Royal Street.jpg|thumb|alt=Three-storey rectangular building|upright|The LaLaurie Mansion in [[New Orleans]] was purchased anonymously by Cage in 2007 and sold in 2009.]]

Samuel Levin filed a counter-complaint and responded to the lawsuit in a filing stating that he warned Cage that he was living beyond his means and urged him to spend less. Levin's filing states that "instead of listening to Levin, cross-defendant Cage (Coppola) spent most of his free time shopping for high ticket purchases, and wound up with 15 personal residences." Levin's complaint continued: "Likewise, Levin advised Coppola against buying a Gulfstream jet, against buying and owning a flotilla of yachts, against buying and owning a squadron of Rolls Royces, against buying millions of dollars in jewelry and art."<ref name="money.cnn.com" />

In his filing, Levin says that in 2007, Cage's "shopping spree entailed the purchase of three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces); 12 purchases of expensive jewelry; and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items."<ref name="money.cnn.com" /> One of those items was a dinosaur skull of a ''[[Tarbosaurus]]''; after discovering that it was stolen, he has since returned it to the Mongolian authorities.<ref name="I0pa7" />

According to Cage, he owned the "Most Haunted House in America," a home located in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana.<ref name="letterman" /> Known as "The LaLaurie House" after its former owner [[Delphine LaLaurie]], the house was foreclosed and sold at auction on November 12, 2009, along with another New Orleans property for a total of $5.5&nbsp;million, in the wake of Cage's financial problems.<ref name="foreclose" /> His [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] home, which had six loans totaling $18&nbsp;million on it, failed to sell at an April 2010 foreclosure auction despite an opening offer of $10.4&nbsp;million, substantially less than the $35&nbsp;million that Cage had originally tried to sell it for. The home, built in 1940 for $110,000, had been owned at different times by [[Dean Martin]] and singer [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]].<ref name="beale" />

The home eventually sold in November 2010 for $10.5&nbsp;million.<ref name="beale2" /> Another home in Nevada also faces foreclosure auction.<ref name="foreclose" /> In November 2011, Cage also sold his [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] in an online auction managed by [[Heritage Auctions]] for a record-breaking $2.16&nbsp;million (the previous record being $1.5&nbsp;million), to assist paying his tax liens and other debts. Cage purchased the comic in 1997 for $110,000.<ref name="Gyd4X" /> The comic had been stolen from him in 2000 and Cage had received an insurance payment on this item. In March 2011, it was found in a storage locker in the [[San Fernando Valley]] and was verified by ComicConnect.com to be the copy sold to Cage previously.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/apr/10/simi-man-helps-recover-1-million-comic-book-from/ | title=Simi man helps recover $1 million comic book stolen from Nicolas Cage | last=Harris | first=Mike | date=April 10, 2011 | work=[[Ventura County Star]] | access-date=June 14, 2011}}</ref> Worth around $25&nbsp;million by May 2017, Cage was reportedly "taking [film] roles left and right" in order to pay off his remaining debts.<ref name="Martin.Emmie" /> By 2022, Cage confirmed that he had finally paid off his debts and intended to be more selective with his film roles moving forward.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Jacob |date=2022-03-23 |title=Nicolas Cage Confirms He Paid Off His Debts, Disses Disney As He Promotes 'The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent' |url=https://boundingintocomics.com/2022/03/23/nicolas-cage-confirms-he-paid-off-his-debts-disses-disney-as-he-promotes-the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent/ |access-date=2022-03-27 |website=Bounding Into Comics |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Legal issues===

The suit was in response to an order that she leave the dwelling; the order resulted from Cage's financial difficulties.<ref name="freepress12D" /> The case was settled in June 2011.<ref name="6qVN1" />

Cage was arrested in New Orleans' [[French Quarter]] district on April 15, 2011 for suspicion of domestic abuse [[Battery (crime)|battery]], disturbing the peace and public intoxication. A police officer was flagged down by onlookers after Cage allegedly grabbed his wife's upper arm while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol.<ref name="h9ax4" /> Cage was held in police custody until a bail of $11,000 was posted by [[Duane "Dog" Chapman]].<ref name="8sPaU" /> He was later ordered to appear in court on May 31, 2011.<ref name="TDxiQ" /> The New Orleans District Attorney announced that the charges against Cage had been dropped on May 5, 2011.<ref name="lb57p" /><ref name="UySAk" />
