[[Wine production]] and consumption increased, burgeoning from the 15th century onwards as part of [[Age of Discovery|European expansion]]. Despite the devastating 1887 [[phylloxera]] louse infestation, modern science and technology adapted and industrial wine production and wine consumption now occur throughout the world.

==Prehistory==
[[File:Archeological sites - wine and oil (English).svg|thumb|500px|Archaeological sites of the [[Neolithic]], [[Copper Age]], and early [[Bronze Age]] in which vestiges of [[viticulture|wine]] and [[olive growing|olive]] growing have been found.]]

===Vine domestication===
The origins of wine predate [[history of writing|written records]], and [[modern archaeology]] is still uncertain about the details of the first cultivation of wild [[grapevine]]s. It has been hypothesized that early humans climbed trees to pick berries, liked their sugary flavor, and then began collecting them. After a few days with fermentation setting in, juice at the bottom of any container would begin producing low-alcohol wine. According to this theory, things changed around 10,000–8000 BC with the transition from a nomadic to a sedentism style of living, which led to agriculture and wine domestication.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWh2AAAAQBAJ&q=PT18&pg=PT18|title=Wine Grapes|author1=Jancis Robinson |author2=Julia Harding |author3=Jose Vouillamoz |year=2013|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=9780062325518}}</ref>

Wild grapes grow in the [[Caucasus|Caucasus region]] ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), the northern [[Levant]], coastal and southeastern [[Turkey]], and northern [[Iran]]. The fermenting of strains of this wild ''[[Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris]]'' (the ancestor of the modern wine grape, ''[[V. vinifera]]'') would have become easier following the development of [[pottery]] during the later [[Neolithic]], {{circa|lk=no|11,000}} BC. The earliest discovered evidence, however, dates from several millennia later.

Domesticated grapes were abundant in the [[Near East]] from the beginning of the early [[Bronze Age]], starting in 3200&nbsp;BC. There is also increasingly abundant evidence for winemaking in [[Sumer]] and [[Egypt]] in the 3rd millennium BC.<ref>{{cite news | first=Dan | last=Verango | title=White wine turns up in King Tutankhamen's tomb | date=2006-05-29 | url =https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2006-05-29-tut-white-wine_x.htm | work =USA Today | access-date = 2007-09-06 }}</ref>

=== Legends of discovery ===
[[File:Mei.jpg|thumb|219x219px|[[Persian wine|Wine]] (''mey'') has been a theme of [[Persian poetry]] for millennia.]]
There are many [[etiological myth]]s told about the first cultivation of the grapevine and fermentation of wine.

The [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Book of Genesis]] first mentions the production of wine by Noah following the [[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]].

[[Greek mythology]] placed the childhood of [[Dionysus]] and his discovery of [[viticulture]] at [[Mount Nysa]] but had him teach the practice to the peoples of central [[Anatolia]]. Because of this, he was rewarded to become a god of wine.

In [[Persia]]n legend, [[Persian king|King]] [[Jamshid]] banished a lady of his [[harem]], causing her to become despondent and contemplate suicide. Going to the king's warehouse, the woman sought out a jar marked "poison" containing the remnants of the grapes that had spoiled and were now deemed undrinkable. After drinking the fermented wine, she found her spirits lifted. She took her discovery to the king, who became so enamored of his new drink that he not only accepted the woman back but also decreed that all grapes grown in [[Persepolis]] would be devoted to winemaking.<ref name="Pellechia pg XI-XII">Pellechia, T.

According to the latest research scholars stated: "Following the definition of the CNCCEF, China has been viewed as "New New World" in the world wine map, despite the fact that grape growing and wine making in China date back to between 7000BCE and 9000BCE. Winemaking technology and wine culture are rooted in Chinese history and the definition of "New New World" is a misnomer that imparts a Euro centric bias onto wine history and ignores fact."<ref name="Li_et_al"/> Furthermore, the history of Chinese grape wine has been confirmed and proven to date back 9000 years (7000 BC),<ref name="Li_et_al"/><ref name="Li&Bardaji"/><ref name="Cañete_et_al"/><ref name="Castro-Sowinski"/><ref name="Hames"/><ref name="McGovern"/> including "the earliest attested use" of wild grapes in wine as well as "earliest chemically confirmed alcoholic beverage in the world", according to Adjunct Professor of Anthropology Patrick McGovern, the Scientific Director of the Biomolecular Archaeology Project for Cuisine, Fermented Beverages, and Health at the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia.<ref name="McGovern"/> Professor McGovern continued: "The Jiahu discovery illustrates how you should never give up hope in finding chemical evidence for a fermented beverage from the Palaeolithic period. Research very often has big surprises in store. You might think, as I did too, that the grape wines of Hajji Firuz, the Caucasus, and eastern Anatolia would prove to be the earliest alcoholic beverages in the world, coming from the so-called "Cradle of Civilization" in the Near East as they do. But then I was invited to go to China on the other side of Asia, and came back with samples that proved to be even earlier–from around 7000 BC."<ref name="McGovern"/> Furthermore, other scholarly research has stated that: "There is also evidence for various types of alcoholic beverage production, including rice and grape wine, beer, and various liquors including baijiu in China, ca. 7000 B.C."<ref name="Castro-Sowinski"/> Additionally, Professor Hames' research stated: "The earliest wine, or fermented liquor, came from China, predating Middle Eastern alcohol by a few thousand years. Archeologists have found pottery shards showing remnants of rice and grape wine dating back to 7000 BCE in Jiahu village in Henan province."<ref name="Hames"/>

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:Ägyptischer Maler um 1500 v. Chr. 001.jpg|thumb|Grape cultivation, winemaking, and commerce in ancient Egypt {{circa|lk=no|1500}} BC]]
[[File:Turkey.Bodrum036.jpg|thumb|Egyptian wine jars, 6th-4th century BC]]
Wine played an important role in [[ancient Egypt]]ian ceremonial life. A thriving royal winemaking industry was established in the [[Nile Delta]] following the introduction of grape cultivation from the [[Levant]] to Egypt {{circa|lk=no|3000}}&nbsp;BC. The industry was most likely the result of trade between Egypt and [[Canaan]] during the early [[Bronze Age]], commencing from at least the 27th-century&nbsp;BC [[Third Dynasty]], the beginning of the [[Old Kingdom]] period. Winemaking scenes on tomb walls, and the offering lists that accompanied them, included wine that was definitely produced in the delta vineyards. By the end of the Old Kingdom, five distinct wines, probably all produced in the Delta, constituted a canonical set of provisions for the afterlife.

Wine in ancient Egypt was predominantly [[red wine|red]]. Due to its resemblance to blood, much superstition surrounded wine-drinking in Egyptian culture. ''[[Shedeh]]'', the most precious drink in ancient Egypt, is now known to have been a red wine and not fermented from [[pomegranate]]s as previously thought.<ref>Maria Rosa Guasch-Jané, Cristina Andrés-Lacueva, Olga Jáuregui and Rosa M. Lamuela-Raventós, The origin of the ancient Egyptian drink Shedeh revealed using LC/MS/MS, Journal of Archaeological Science, Vol 33, Iss 1, Jan. 2006, pp. 98–101.</ref> [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Moralia]]'' relates that, prior to [[Psammetichus I]], the [[pharaoh]]s did not drink wine nor [[libation|offer it to the gods]] "thinking it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods and from whom, when they had fallen and had become commingled with the earth, they believed vines to have sprung". This was considered to be the reason why drunkenness "drives men out of their senses and crazes them, inasmuch as they are then filled with the blood of their forebears".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html | title = Isis & Osiris | publisher = University of Chicago}}</ref>

Residue from five clay [[amphora]]s in [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb, however, have been shown to be that of [[white wine]], so it was at least available to the Egyptians through trade if not produced domestically.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2006-05-29-tut-white-wine_x.htm White wine turns up in King Tutankhamen's tomb].

===Phoenicia===
{{Main|Phoenicians and wine|Lebanese wine}}
As recipients of winemaking knowledge from areas to the east, the Phoenicians were instrumental in distributing wine, wine grapes, and winemaking technology throughout the Mediterranean region through their extensive trade network. Their use of [[amphora]]s for transporting wine was widely adopted and Phoenician-distributed grape varieties were important in the development of the wine industries of Rome and Greece.

The only [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] recipe to survive the [[Punic Wars]] was one by [[Mago (agricultural writer)|Mago]] for [[passum]], a [[raisin wine]] that later became popular in [[ancient Rome|Rome]] as well.

===Ancient Greece===
{{Main|Ancient Greece and wine}}
[[File:Dionysos vineyard MNE Villa Giulia 106463.jpg|thumb|180px|Dionysus in a vineyard; amphora dated to the late 6th century BC]]
Much of modern wine culture derives from the practices of the ancient Greeks. The vine preceded both the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cultures.<ref name="greekwinemakers.com"/><ref name="dsc.discovery.com"/> Many of the grapes grown in modern Greece are grown there exclusively and are similar or identical to the [[varietal|varieties]] grown in ancient times. Indeed, the most popular modern Greek wine, a strongly aromatic white called [[retsina]], is thought to be a carryover from the ancient practice of lining the [[amphora|wine jugs]] with tree resin, imparting a distinct flavor to the drink.

The "Feast of the Wine" (''Me-tu-wo Ne-wo'') was a festival in [[Mycenaean Greece]] celebrating the "Month of the New Wine".<ref>[https://archive.today/20120630174743/http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/26.html Mycenaean and Late Cycladic Religion and Religious Architecture], Dartmouth College</ref><ref>T.G.

In Homeric mythology, wine is usually served in "[[krater|mixing bowls]]" rather than consumed in an undiluted state.

The earliest reference to a named wine is from the 7th-century BC lyrical poet [[Alcman]], who praises ''Dénthis'', a wine from the western foothills of Mount [[Taygetus]] in [[Messenia]], as ''anthosmías'' ("flowery-scented").

If so, this makes Lemnió the oldest known varietal still in cultivation.

For Greece, alcohol such as wine had not fully developed into the rich 'cash crop' that it would eventually become toward the peak of its reign. However, as the emphasis of viticulture increased with economic demand so did the consumption of alcohol during the years to come. The Greeks embraced the production aspect as a way to expand and create economic growth throughout the region. Greek wine was widely known and exported throughout the [[Mediterranean]], as [[amphora]]s with Greek styling and art have been found throughout the area. The Greeks may have even been involved in the first appearance of wine in ancient Egypt.<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146412958&mode=thread&order=06500 year old Mashed grapes found] World's earliest evidence of crushed grapes</ref> They introduced the ''V. vinifera'' vine to<ref name=Jacobson>Introduction to Wine Laboratory Practices and Procedures, Jean L.

===Roman Empire===
{{Main|Ancient Rome and wine}}
[[File:Commerce du vin sur la Durance (époque gallo-romaine).png|thumb|Shipping wine in Roman Gaul: [[amphora]]s (top) were the traditional Mediterranean vessels, but the Gauls introduced the use of barrels.]]
The [[Roman Empire]] had an immense impact on the development of [[viticulture]] and [[oenology]]. Wine was an integral part of the Roman diet and winemaking became a precise business. Virtually all of the major [[wine-producing regions]] of Western Europe today were established during the Roman Imperial era. During the Roman Empire, social norms began to shift as the production of alcohol increased. Further evidence suggests that widespread drunkenness and true alcoholism among the Romans began in the first century BC and reached its height in the first century AD.<ref>Jellinek, E. M. 1976. "Drinkers and Alcoholics in Ancient Rome." Edited by Carole D. Yawney and Robert E. Popham. Journal of Studies on Alcohol 37 (11): 1718-1740.</ref> Viniculture expanded so much that by AD {{circa|lk=no|92}} the [[list of Roman emperors|emperor]] [[Domitian]] was forced to pass the first [[wine laws]] on record, banning the planting of any new vineyards in [[Roman Italy|Italy]] and uprooting half of the vineyards in the [[Roman provinces|provinces]] in order to increase the production of the necessary but less profitable grain. (The measure was widely ignored but remained on the books until its 280 repeal by [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]].<ref name=jro>J. Robinson (ed). ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'', 3rd Ed., p. 234.

Winemaking technology improved considerably during the time of the Roman Empire, though technologies from the [[Bronze Age]] continued to be used alongside newer innovations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dodd|first=Emlyn|title=Pressing Issues: A New Discovery in the Vineyard of Region I.20, Pompeii|url=https://www.academia.edu/35130874|journal=Archeologia Classica|language=en}}</ref><ref name="DODD, EMLYN K. 2020"/> [[Vitruvius]] noted how wine storage rooms were specially built facing north, "since that quarter is never subject to change but is always constant and unshifting",<ref>[[Vitruvius]]. ''[[De architectura]]'', I.4.2.</ref> and special [[smokehouse]]s (''[[fumarium|fumaria]]'') were developed to speed or mimic [[aging (wine)|aging]]. Many grape varieties and cultivation techniques were developed. Barrels (invented by the [[Gauls]]) and glass bottles (invented by the [[Syrians]]) began to compete with [[terracotta]] [[amphora]]s for storing and shipping wine. The Romans also created a precursor to today's appellation systems, as certain regions gained reputations for their fine wines. The most famous was the white [[Falernian wine|Falernian]] from the [[Latium|Latian]]–[[Campania]]n border, principally because of its high (~15%) alcohol content. The Romans recognized three appellations: [[Caucinian Falernian]] from the highest slopes, [[Faustian Falernian]] from the center (named for its one-time owner [[Faustus Cornelius Sulla (quaestor 54 BC)|Faustus Cornelius Sulla]], son of the [[Sulla|dictator]]), and generic Falernian from the lower slopes and plain. The esteemed vintages grew in value as they aged, and each region produced different varieties as well: dry, sweet, and light. Other famous wines were the sweet [[Alban wine|Alban]] from the [[Alban Hills]] and the [[Caecuban wine|Caecuban]] beloved by [[Horace]] and extirpated by [[Nero]]. Pliny cautioned that such 'first-growth' wines not be smoked in a ''fumarium'' like lesser vintages.<ref>Hugh Johnson, ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 72. Simon and Schuster 1989.</ref> [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and others also named ''vinum Hadrianum'' as one of the most rated wines, along with Praetutian from Ancona on the Adriatic, Mamertine from Messina in Sicily, Rhaetic from Verona, and a few others.<ref>Merton Sandler, Roger Pinder, ''[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=yq2W6dwJa5gC&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=hadrianum+wine&source=bl&ots=1nHWS7CPpr&sig=ACfU3U09EvefeTMarQQ5emJxdgwMs5SG7Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj8-8muwODnAhWFPXAKHRfGB3oQ6AEwEXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=hadrianum%20wine&f=false Wine: A Scientific Exploration]'' p. 66, 2003, {{ISBN|0203373944}}</ref>

Wine, perhaps mixed with herbs and minerals, was assumed to serve medicinal purposes. During Roman times, the upper classes might dissolve [[pearl]]s in wine for better health. [[Cleopatra]] created her own legend by promising [[Mark Antony|Antony]] she would "drink the value of a province" in one cup of wine, after which she drank an expensive pearl with a cup of the beverage.<ref name="farlang" /> [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] relates that, after the ascension of [[Augustus]], [[Setinum wine|Setinum]] became the imperial wine because it did not cause him indigestion.<ref>Pliny. ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'', XIV.61.</ref> When the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire fell]] during the 5th century, Europe entered a period of invasions and social turmoil, with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as the only stable social structure. Through the Church, grape growing and winemaking technology, essential for the Mass, were preserved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeinitaly.com/wines/history.asp|title=History of Wine I|website=Life in Italy|date=2018-10-28|access-date=21 March 2007|archive-date=9 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909210847/http://www.lifeinitaly.com/wines/history.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Over the course of the later Empire, wine production gradually shifted to the east as Roman infrastructure and influence in the western regions gradually diminished. Production in Asia Minor, the Aegean and the Near East flourished through Late Antiquity and the Byzantine era.<ref name="DODD, EMLYN K. 2020"/>

==Medieval period==

===Medieval Middle East===
{{Main|Wine in the Middle East}}
{{See also|Phoenicians and wine|Lebanese wine}}
[[Lebanon]] is among the oldest sites of [[Winemaking|wine production]] in the world.<ref>McGovern, Patrick E. 2003. Ancient Wine: The Search for the Origins of viniculture. Princeton University Press</ref> The [[Israelite]] [[Hosea]] (780–725 BC) is said to have urged his followers to return to Yahweh so that "they will blossom as the vine, [and] their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon".<ref>quoted from McGovern, Patrick E. 2003. op. cit., p. 202</ref> The [[Phoenicians]] of its coastal strip were instrumental in spreading wine and viticulture throughout the [[Mediterranean]] in ancient times.

However, in the [[Arabian peninsula]], wine was traded by Aramaic merchants, as the climate was not well-suited to the growing of vines. Many other types of fermented drinks, however, were produced in the 5th and 6th centuries, including date and honey wines.

The Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries brought many territories under Muslim control. Alcoholic drinks were prohibited by law, but the production of alcohol, wine in particular, seems to have thrived. Wine was a subject for many poets, even under Islamic rule, and many [[Khilafah|khalifas]] used to drink alcoholic beverages during their social and private meetings. Egyptian Jews leased vineyards from the [[Fatimid]] and [[Mamluk]] governments, produced wine for sacramental and medicinal use, and traded wine throughout the Eastern [[Mediterranean]]. 
[[File:Monk tasting wine from a barrel.jpg|thumb|upright|Monastic cellarer tasting wine, from ''Li Livres dou Santé'' (French manuscript, late 13th century)]]
Christian monasteries in the [[Levant]] and Iraq often cultivated grapevines; they then distributed their vintages in taverns located on monastery grounds. [[Zoroastrians]] in Persia and Central Asia also engaged in the production of wine. Though not much is known about their wine trade, they did become known for their taverns. Wine in general found an industrial use in the medieval Middle East as [[raw material|feedstock]] after advances in [[distillation]] by [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Muslim]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] allowed for the production of relatively pure [[ethanol]], which was used in the [[perfume]] industry. Wine was also for the first time distilled into [[brandy]] during this period.

In the [[Middle Ages]], wine was the common drink of all social classes in the south, where grapes were cultivated. In the north and east, where few if any grapes were grown, [[beer]] and [[ale]] were the usual beverages of both commoners and nobility. Wine was exported to the northern regions, but because of its relatively high expense was seldom consumed by the lower classes. Since wine was necessary, however, for the celebration of the [[Catholic Mass]], assuring a supply was crucial. The [[Benedictine]] monks became one of the largest producers of wine in France and Germany, followed closely by the [[Cistercian]]s. Other orders, such as the [[Carthusians]], the [[Templars]], and the [[Carmelites]], are also notable both historically and in modern times as wine producers. The Benedictines owned vineyards in [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]] ([[Dom Pérignon (person)|Dom Perignon]] was a Benedictine monk), [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], and [[Bordeaux]] in France, and in the [[Rheingau]] and [[Franconia]] in Germany. In 1435 Count John&nbsp;IV of [[Katzenelnbogen]], a wealthy member of the Holy Roman high nobility near [[Frankfurt]], was the first to plant [[Riesling]], the most important German grape. The nearby winemaking monks made it into an industry, producing enough wine to ship all over Europe for secular use. In [[Portugal]], a country with one of the oldest wine traditions, the first appellation system in the world was created.

A housewife of the merchant class or a servant in a noble household would have served wine at every meal, and had a selection of reds and whites alike. Home recipes for [[mead]]s from this period are still in existence, along with recipes for spicing and masking flavors in wines, including the simple act of adding a small amount of [[honey]]. As wines were kept in barrels, they were not extensively aged, and thus drunk quite young. To offset the effects of heavy alcohol consumption, wine was frequently watered down at a ratio of four or five parts water to one of wine.

One medieval application of wine was the use of snake-stones (banded [[agate]] resembling the figural rings on a [[snake]]) dissolved in wine as a remedy for snake bites, which shows an early understanding of the effects of alcohol on the central nervous system in such situations.<ref name="farlang" />

[[Jofroi of Waterford]], a 13th-century Dominican, wrote a catalogue of all the known wines and ales of Europe, describing them with great relish and recommending them to academics and counsellors. [[Rashi]], a [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval French]] [[rabbi]] called the "father" of all subsequent commentaries on the Talmud and the Tanakh,<ref name="chabad">Miller, Chaim. ''Chabad''.

==Modern era==

===Spread and development in the Americas===
{{see also|New World wine}}
European grape varieties were first brought to what is now Mexico by the first Spanish [[conquistador]]s to provide the necessities of the Catholic [[Holy Eucharist]]. Planted at Spanish [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]s, one variety came to be known as the [[Mission (grape)|Mission grape]] and is still planted today in small amounts. Succeeding waves of immigrants imported French, Italian and German grapes, although wine from those native to the Americas (whose flavors can be distinctly different) is also produced. Mexico became the most important wine producer starting in the 16th century, to the extent that its output began to affect Spanish commercial production. In this competitive climate, the Spanish king sent an executive order to halt Mexico's production of wines and the planting of vineyards.

During the devastating phylloxera blight in late 19th-century Europe, it was found that Native American vines were immune to the pest. [[French-American hybrid]] grapes were developed and saw some use in Europe, but more important was the practice of grafting European grapevines to American rootstocks to protect vineyards from the insect. The practice continues to this day wherever phylloxera is present.

Today, wine in the Americas is often associated with [[Argentina]], [[California wine|California]] and [[Chilean wine|Chile]] all of which produce a wide variety of wines, from inexpensive jug wines to high-quality varietals and proprietary blends. Most of the wine production in the Americas is based on Old World grape varieties, and wine-growing regions there have often "adopted" grapes that have become particularly closely identified with them. California's [[Zinfandel]] (from Croatia and Southern Italy), Argentina's [[Malbec]], and Chile's [[Carmenère]] (both from France) are well-known examples.

Until the latter half of the 20th century, American wine was generally viewed as inferior to that of Europe. However, with the surprisingly favorable American showing at the [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Paris Wine tasting of 1976]], New World wine began to garner respect in the land of wine's origins.

===Developments in Europe===
{{Main|Great French Wine Blight}}
In the late 19th century, the [[phylloxera]] louse brought widespread destruction to grapevines, wine production, and those whose livelihoods depended on them; far-reaching repercussions included the loss of many indigenous varieties. Lessons learned from the infestation led to the positive transformation of Europe's wine industry. Bad vineyards were uprooted and their land turned to better uses. Some of France's best [[butter]] and [[cheese]], for example, is now made from cows that graze on [[Charentais]] soil, which was previously covered with vines. ''Cuvées'' were also standardized, important in creating certain wines as they are known today; Champagne and Bordeaux finally achieved the grape mixes that now define them. In the [[Balkans]], where phylloxera had had little impact, the local varieties survived. However, the uneven transition from Ottoman rule has meant only gradual transformation in many vineyards. It is only in recent times that local varieties have gained recognition beyond "mass-market" wines like [[retsina]].

===Australia, New Zealand and South Africa===
{{See also|History of South African wine|Australian wine#History}}
In the context of wine, [[Australian wine|Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and other countries without a wine tradition are considered New World producers. Wine production began in the [[Cape Province]] of what is now South Africa in the 1680s as a business for supplying ships. Australia's [[First Fleet]] (1788) brought cuttings of vines from South Africa, although initial plantings failed and the first successful vineyards were established in the early 19th century. Until quite late in the 20th century, the product of these countries was not well known outside their small export markets. For example, Australia exported mainly to the United Kingdom; New Zealand retained most of its wine for domestic consumption, and South Africa exported to the Kings of Europe. However, with the increase in mechanization and scientific advances in winemaking, these countries became known for high-quality wine. A notable exception to the foregoing is that the Cape Province was the largest exporter of wine to Europe in the 18th century.
