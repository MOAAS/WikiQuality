A '''car''' (or '''automobile''') is a wheeled [[motor vehicle]] used for [[transportation]]. Most definitions of ''cars'' say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four [[wheels]], and mainly transport people rather than goods.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pocket Oxford Dictionary|url=https://archive.org/details/australianpocket00john|url-access=registration|year=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198611134|editor-last=Fowler|editor-first=H.W.|editor-last2=Fowler|editor-first2=F.G.}}</ref><ref name="OEDmotrcar"/> 

Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and [[Developed country|developed economies]] depend on them.

[[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]] is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica {{cite web|title=Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/145966/Nicolas-Joseph-Cugnot}}</ref>  He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers|French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</ref> His inventions were, however, handicapped by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/> In 1801, [[Richard Trevithick]] built and demonstrated his [[The Puffing Devil|Puffing Devil]] road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.

The development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the [[history of the car]] but often treated separately from the development of true cars.  A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including [[steam car]]s, [[steam bus]]es, [[phaeton (carriage)|phaetons]], and [[steam roller]]s.  In the [[United Kingdom]], sentiment against them led to the [[Locomotive Acts]] of 1865.

In 1807, [[Nicéphore Niépce]] and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first [[internal combustion engine]] (which they called a [[Pyréolophore]]), but they chose to install it in a boat on the river [[Saone]] in France.<ref name="NieMus">{{cite web|author=speos.fr|url=http://niepce.house.museum/pagus/pagus-other.html|title=Niepce Museum, Other Inventions|publisher=Niepce.house.museum|access-date=2010-08-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220092838/http://niepce.house.museum/pagus/pagus-other.html|archive-date=2005-12-20}}</ref> Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor [[François Isaac de Rivaz]] designed his own '[[De Rivaz engine|de Rivaz internal combustion engine]]' and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Niépces' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of [[Lycopodium powder]] (dried spores of the [[Lycopodium]] plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]].<ref name="NieMus"/> Neither design was very successful, as was the case with others, such as [[Samuel Brown (engineer)|Samuel Brown]], [[Samuel Morey]], and [[Etienne Lenoir]] with his [[Hippomobile (car)|hippomobile]], who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.<ref name=stein>{{cite book|title=The Automobile Book|publisher=Paul Hamlyn|year=1967|first=Ralph|last=Stein}}</ref>

[[File:1885Benz.jpg|thumb|The original [[Benz Patent-Motorwagen]], first built in 1885 and awarded the patent for the concept]]

In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first ''Motorwagen'' was built in 1885 in [[Mannheim]], Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, [[Benz & Cie.]], which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model. They also were powered with [[Four-stroke cycle|four-stroke]] engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888 [[Bertha Benz]], the wife of Carl Benz, undertook the first [[road trip]] by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention.

[[File:Berthabenzportrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Bertha Benz]], the first long distance driver]]

In 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion [[flat engine]], called ''boxermotor''. During the last years of the nineteenth century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a [[joint-stock company]]. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by [[Czech lands|Czech]] company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]]) in 1897, the [[Präsident]] automobil.

Daimler and Maybach founded [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG) in [[Cannstatt]] in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name ''Daimler''. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895 about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named ''Daimler-Mercedes'' that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by [[Emil Jellinek]]. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35&nbsp;hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the ''Daimler'' brand name were sold to other manufacturers.

Carl Benz proposed co-operation between DMG and Benz & Cie. when economic conditions began to deteriorate in Germany following the [[First World War]], but the directors of DMG refused to consider it initially. Negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened, and in 1924, they signed an Agreement of Mutual Interest, valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, and sales and they advertised or marketed their car models jointly, although keeping their respective brands. On 28 June 1926, Benz & Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its cars Mercedes Benz, as a brand honoring the most important model of the DMG cars, the Maybach design later referred to as the 1902 Mercedes-35&nbsp;hp, along with the Benz name. Carl Benz remained a member of the board of directors of Daimler-Benz until his death in 1929, and at times, his two sons also participated in the management of the company.

In 1890, [[Émile Levassor]] and [[Armand Peugeot]] of [[France]] began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the [[Automotive industry in France#1900 to 1950|automotive industry in France]]. In 1891, [[Auguste Doriot]] and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a gasoline-powered vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered [[Peugeot Type 3]] completed {{convert|2100|km|mi|abbr=in|-1}} from [[Valentigney]] to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first [[Paris–Brest–Paris]] bicycle race, but finished 6 days after the winning cyclist, [[Charles Terront]].

The first design for an American car with a gasoline internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by [[George Baldwin Selden|George Selden]] of [[Rochester, New York]]. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of sixteen years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a United States patent ({{US patent|549160}}) for a [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] car engine, [[George B. Selden#The Selden patent|which hindered, more than encouraged]], development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by [[Henry Ford]] and others, and overturned in 1911.

In 1893, the first running, gasoline-powered [[Automotive industry in the United States|American car]] was built and road-tested by the [[Duryea brothers]] of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].

In 1892, German engineer [[Rudolf Diesel]] was granted a patent for a "New Rational Combustion Engine".

Large-scale, [[production-line]] manufacturing of affordable cars was started by [[Ransom Olds]] in 1901 at his [[Oldsmobile]] factory in [[Lansing, Michigan]] and based upon stationary [[assembly line]] techniques pioneered by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]], England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the U.S. by [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]] in 1821, at the [[Springfield Armory]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/pabacker/industrial.htm|title=Industrialization of American Society|publisher=Engr.sjsu.edu|access-date=2011-07-17|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919085515/http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/pabacker/industrial.htm|archive-date=2010-09-19}}</ref> This concept was greatly expanded by [[Henry Ford]], beginning in 1913 with the world's first ''moving'' assembly line for cars at the [[Highland Park Ford Plant]].

As a result, Ford's cars came off the line in fifteen-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5-man-hours to 1 hour 33 minutes).<ref name=Georgano>{{cite book|last=Georgano|first=G. N.|title=Vintage Cars 1886 to 1930|year=2000|publisher=AB Nordbok|location=Sweden|isbn=1-85501-926-4}}</ref> It was so successful, [[paint]] became a bottleneck. Only [[Japan black]] would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1913, until fast-drying [[Duco]] [[lacquer]] was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford's [[apocryphal]] remark, "any color as long as it's black".<ref name=Georgano/> In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.<ref name=Georgano/>

Ford's complex safety procedures—especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about—dramatically reduced the rate of injury.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called "[[Fordism]]," and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.

In the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, [[Citroën]] was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.<ref name=Georgano/>

Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric [[ignition system|ignition]] and the electric self-starter (both by [[Charles Kettering]], for the [[Cadillac]] Motor Company in 1910–1911), independent [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and four-wheel brakes.

Since the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was [[Alfred P. Sloan]] who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the [[General Motors Companion Make Program]], so that buyers could "move up" as their fortunes improved.

Reflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]]s, sold by [[Cadillac]], used cheaper mechanical parts made by [[Oldsmobile]]; in the 1950s, [[Chevrolet]] shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]]; by the 1990s, corporate [[powertrain]]s and shared [[Automobile platform|platforms]] (with interchangeable [[brake]]s, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as [[Apperson]], [[Cole Motor Car Company|Cole]], [[Dorris Motors Corporation|Dorris]], [[Haynes Automobile Company|Haynes]], or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the [[Great Depression]], by 1940, only 17 of those were left.<ref name=Georgano/>

In Europe, much the same would happen. [[Morris Motors|Morris]] set up its production line at [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practice of [[vertical integration]], buying [[Hotchkiss (car)|Hotchkiss]] (engines), [[EG Wrigley and Company|Wrigley]] (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]]: in 1925, Morris had 41% of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from [[Abbey (1922 automobile)|Abbey]] to [[Xtra (automobile)|Xtra]], had gone under. Citroën did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as [[Renault]]'s 10CV and [[Peugeot]]'s [[Peugeot 5CV|5CV]], they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and [[Mors (automobile)|Mors]], [[Hurtu]], and others could not compete.<ref name=Georgano/> Germany's first mass-manufactured car, the [[Opel]] [[Opel Laubfrosch|4PS ''Laubfrosch'']] (Tree Frog), came off the line at [[Rüsselsheim]] in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5% of the market.<ref name=Georgano/>

In Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like [[Daihatsu]], or were the result of partnering with European companies, like [[Isuzu Motors|Isuzu]] building the [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley A-9]] in 1922. [[Mitsubishi]] was also partnered with [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat]] and built the [[Mitsubishi Model A]] based on a Fiat vehicle. [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], [[Suzuki]], [[Mazda]], and [[Honda]] began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda's decision to take [[Toyoda Loom Works]] into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become [[Toyota Motor Corporation]], the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. [[Subaru]], meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as [[Fuji Heavy Industries]], as a result of having been broken up under ''[[keiretsu]]'' legislation.

{{See also|Car controls}}
Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort, and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 21st-century cars. These controls include a [[steering wheel]], pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation, and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardized, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example, the [[electric car]] and the integration of mobile communications.

Some of the original controls are no longer required. For example, all cars once had controls for the choke valve, clutch, [[ignition timing]], and a crank instead of an electric [[Starter (engine)|starter]]. However new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. These include [[Automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]], [[Automotive navigation system|navigation systems]], and [[in car entertainment]]. Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as [[BMW]]'s ''[[iDrive]]'' and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s ''[[MyFord Touch]]''. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the early 2020s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.

Cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include [[headlight]]s, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, [[daytime running lights]]; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-colored reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.

==Seating and body style==
{{See also|Car body style|Car classification|Truck classification|Vehicle size class
}}
Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. [[Full-size car]]s and large [[sport utility vehicle]]s can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, [[sports car]]s are most often designed with only two seats. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan/saloon]], [[hatchback]], [[station wagon]]/estate, and [[minivan]].

===Open source development===
{{main|Open source car}}
There have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of [[open design]], an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared, often without monetary compensation. None of the projects have succeeded in developing a car as a whole including both hardware and software, and no mass production ready open-source based designs have been introduced. Some car [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacking]] through [[on-board diagnostics]] (OBD) has been done so far.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6306814203245314335|title=Geek My Ride presentation at linux.conf.au 2009|access-date=2010-07-11|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411075600/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6306814203245314335|archive-date=2011-04-11}}</ref>

==Other meanings==
The term ''motorcar'' was formerly also used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage.  These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laparks.org/grifmet/tt/htmgallery/gallery_urbans/atchison177.htm|title=atchison_177|publisher=Laparks.org|access-date=2011-02-13|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515145403/http://www.laparks.org/grifmet/tt/htmgallery/gallery_urbans/atchison177.htm|archive-date=2011-05-15}}</ref>
