The invasion began on 24 February after Putin's declaration of his intended military intervention.<ref name="Meduza_Putin_announces_invasion" /> The full military operation consisted of infantry divisions supported by armored units and air support in Eastern Ukraine, along with dozens of missile attacks across both Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.<ref name="CriticalThreats" /><ref name="ISW 4MAR" /> Ostensibly, the main infantry and tank division attacks were launched at four spearhead incursions, creating a Northern front (launched towards Kyiv), a Southern front (originating in Crimea), a Southeastern front (launched at the cities of Luhansk and Donbas), and an Eastern front.<ref name="auto3" /><ref name="auto5" /> All four incursions crossed into Ukraine and approximately 100–200 kilometres beyond Ukrainian borders while occupying Ukrainian territory and encircling main cities. By 20 March, the four incursion fronts had formed a perimeter significantly within the entire border of Eastern Ukraine and started to extensively consolidate lines of communication and support between all four fronts within Ukraine while besieging Mariupol, Kyiv, Donbas, Luhansk, and other cities.<ref name="auto3">{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-mariupol-russia-surrender-reject/ |title=Ukraine rejects Russian demand to surrender port city of Mariupol in exchange for safe passage |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=20 March 2022 |access-date=21 March 2022}}</ref><ref name="auto5">{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-march21-1.6391709 |title=Ukraine refuses to surrender Mariupol as scope of human toll remains unclear |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=21 March 2022 |access-date=21 March 2022}}</ref> An extensive missile bombardment campaign was also conducted with dozens of missile strikes across Ukraine, reaching as far west as Lviv.<ref name="auto4">{{cite news |last=Dutton |first=Jack |date=25 February 2022 |title=Russian Military Base Blown Up as Ukraine Fights Back |work=[[Newsweek]] |url=https://www.newsweek.com/russian-military-base-blown-ukraine-fights-back-1682558 |url-status=live |access-date=25 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220225075915/https://www.newsweek.com/russian-military-base-blown-ukraine-fights-back-1682558 |archive-date=25 February 2022}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{cite news |date=25 February 2022 |title=Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked Millerovo with Tochka-U |work=[[Rostov Gazeta]] |url=https://rostovgazeta.ru/news/politics/25-02-2022/vooruzhennye-sily-ukrainy-atakovali-millerovo-tochkoy-u |url-status=live |access-date=25 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220225073113/https://rostovgazeta.ru/news/politics/25-02-2022/vooruzhennye-sily-ukrainy-atakovali-millerovo-tochkoy-u |archive-date=25 February 2022}}</ref>

Russian efforts to capture [[Kyiv]] included a main spearhead striking south from Belarus along the west bank of the [[Dnipro River]], with the apparent aim of encircling the city from the west.

By 20 March, the Russian military appeared to be waging a rapid invasion to achieve its apparent primary goal of the seizure of Kyiv, along with the occupation of Eastern Ukraine and the displacement of the Ukrainian government. Russian forces quickly became stalled while approaching Kyiv due to several factors, including the disparity in morale and performance between Ukrainian and Russian forces, the Ukrainian use of sophisticated man-portable weapons provided by Western allies, poor Russian logistics and equipment performance, the failure of the Russian Air Force to achieve air superiority, and Russian military attrition during their siege of major cities.<ref name="wapo20220320">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/20/russia-ukraine-military-offensive/ |title=Russia's war for Ukraine could be headed toward stalemate |first1=Liz |last1=Sly |first2=Dan |last2=Lamothe |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=20 March 2022 |access-date=24 March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/21/ukraine-is-winning-war-russia-offensive-putin/ |title=Opinion: Against all odds, Ukrainians are winning.

On 17 March, Çavuşoğlu was the first foreign minister to visit Ukraine after the start of the invasion.

On 20 March, Turkish presidential spokesman [[İbrahim Kalın]] said the two sides were getting closer on four key issues.
