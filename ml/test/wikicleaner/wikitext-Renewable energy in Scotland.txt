The production of [[renewable energy]] in [[Scotland]] is a topic that has come to the fore in technical, economic, and political terms during the opening years of the 21st century.<ref>See, for example, Scottish Executive (2005) ''Choosing Our Future: Scotland's Sustainable Development Strategy.'' Edinburgh.</ref> The natural resource base for renewable energy is high by [[Renewable energy in the European Union|European]], and even global standards, with the most important potential sources being [[wind power|wind]], [[wave power|wave]], and [[tidal power|tide]]. Renewables produced the equivalent of 97.4% of Scotland's electricity consumption in 2020, mostly from [[wind power in Scotland|the country's wind power]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=2021-03-25|title=Renewables met 97% of Scotland's electricity demand in 2020|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56530424|access-date=2021-03-31}}</ref>

In 2015, Scotland generated 59% of its electricity consumption through renewable sources, exceeding the country's goal of 50% renewable electricity by that year.<ref name="2015target"/> At the start of 2020, Scotland had 11.8 [[gigawatts]] (GW) of installed renewable electricity capacity, which produced approximately 25% of total UK renewable generation (119,000 GWh).<ref name="BEIS Energy Trends - Renewables">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-trends-section-6-renewables|title=BEIS Energy Trends - Renewables|publisher=UK Government|date=2020-03-26|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> In 2018, Scotland exported over 28 per cent of generation<ref name="Proportion of electricity generation by fuel">{{cite web |url=https://scotland.shinyapps.io/Energy/?Section=RenLowCarbon&Subsection=RenElec&Chart=ElecGen|title=Proportion of electricity generation by fuel|work=Scottish Government: Scottish Energy Statistics Hub|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> and in 2019 renewable electricity generation made up 90% of gross electricity consumption.<ref name=RenLowCarbon>{{Cite web|url=https://scotland.shinyapps.io/Energy/?Section=RenLowCarbon&Subsection=RenElec&Chart=RenElecTarget|title=Share of renewable electricity in gross final consumption|work=Scottish Government: Scottish Energy Statistics Hub|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> In decreasing order of capacity, Scotland's renewable generation comes from onshore wind, [[hydropower]], offshore wind, solar PV and biomass.<ref name="ScotRenNumbers" />

Continuing improvements in engineering and economics are enabling more of the [[renewable resource]]s to be used. Fears regarding [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]] have driven the subject high up the political agenda. The Scottish Government's energy plans now call for 100% of electricity consumption to be generated through renewable sources and that half of total energy consumption (including heat and transportation) will be met from renewables by 2030.<ref name="RES">[https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-energy-strategy-future-energy-scotland-9781788515276/pages/2/ "The future of energy in Scotland: Scottish energy strategy: Executive summary"].

:The main source assumes grid capacity is available. Without this the potential drops significantly to circa 33 TWh.
:The tidal potential of the Pentland Firth alone is estimated elsewhere at over 10 GW.<ref name= Marine/>
:Geothermal potential capacity is estimated from potential output.
:Micro generation (including solar) is estimated as having the potential of producing up to 40% of current electrical demand by 2050 i.e. circa 14 TWh.<ref name=SDC06/> The above figures assume 12% by 2020.}}
!Potential capacity (GW){{efn|Note on 'installed capacity' and 'potential energy'. The former is an estimate of the maximum productive output of a given technology or individual generation station at a single point in time. The latter takes into account the likely intermittency of energy supply and is a measure of output over a period of time. Thus, for example, individual wind turbines may have a 'capacity factor' of between 15% and 45% depending on their location, with a higher capacity factor giving a greater potential energy output for a given installed capacity. The 'potential energy' column is thus an estimate based on a variety of assumptions including the installed capacity. Although 'potential energy' is in some ways a more useful method of comparing the current output and future potential of different technologies, using it would require cumbersome explanations of all the assumptions involved in each example, so installed capacity figures are generally used.}}
!Potential energy ([[TWh]]){{efn|A gigawatt (GW) is a measure of productive capacity. Terawatt-hours (TWh) measure actual output. Thus, an 8GW power station operating ten hours per day will produce 8x10 equals 80 TWh of electricity. Whenever possible this article refers to predictions of maximum output in GW. Using energy productions in TWh might be more useful in some ways but would tend to obscure the underlying assumptions unless every reference included a measure for maximum output, capacity factor and assumed production, which might prove cumbersome.}}

== Geothermal energy ==
{{further|Geothermal power}}
[[Geothermal energy]] is obtained from thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth. The most common form of geothermal energy systems in Scotland provide heating through a [[Ground source heat pump|ground source]] [[heat pump]]. These devices transfer energy from the thermal reservoir of the earth to the surface via shallow pipe works, utilising a heat exchanger. Ground source heat pumps generally achieve a [[Coefficient of performance]] of between 3â4,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lubis|first1=Luthfi I.|last2=Kanoglu|first2=Mehmet|last3=Dincer|first3=Ibrahim|last4=Rosen|first4=Marc A.|date=September 2011|title=Thermodynamic analysis of a hybrid geothermal heat pump system|journal=Geothermics|volume=40|issue=3|pages=233â238|doi=10.1016/j.geothermics.2011.06.004|issn=0375-6505}}</ref> meaning for each unit of energy in, 3-4 units of useful heat energy is outputted. The carbon intensity of this energy is dependent on the carbon intensity of the electricity powering the pump.

Mine-water geothermal systems are also being explored, utilising the consistent ambient temperature of the earth to raise the temperature of water for heating by circulating it through unused mine tunes. The water will generally require further heating in order to reach a usable temperature. An example is the Glenalmond Street project in [[Shettleston]], which uses a combination of solar and geothermal energy to heat 16 houses. Water in a coal mine {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} below ground level is heated by geothermal energy and maintained at a temperature of about 12 [[Celsius|Â°C]] (54 [[Fahrenheit|Â°F]]) throughout the year. The warmed water is raised and passed through a heat pump, boosting the temperature to 55&nbsp;Â°C (131&nbsp;Â°F), and is then distributed to the houses providing heating to radiators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johngilbert.co.uk/resources/geothermal.html|title=Geothermal Energy|publisher=John Gilbert Architects|access-date=9 February 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070205175322/http://www.johngilbert.co.uk/resources/geothermal.html |archive-date = 5 February 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Carbon sequestration===
Also known as [[carbon capture and storage]], this technology involves the storage of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) that is a by-product of industrial processes through its injection into oil fields. It is not a form of renewable energy production, but it may be a way to significantly reduce the effect of fossil fuels whilst renewables are commercialised. It may also be an intermediate step towards a 'hydrogen economy' (see below), which could either enable further renewable development or conceivably out-compete it. The technology has been successfully pioneered in [[Norway]].<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/17411/ "Sequestration science is far ahead of needed policy".] (8 September 2006) MIT Technology Review. Retrieved 24 June 2007.

Although [[hydrogen]] offers significant potential as an alternative to hydrocarbons as a carrier of energy, neither hydrogen itself nor the associated [[fuel cell]] technologies are sources of energy in themselves. Nevertheless, the combination of renewable technologies and hydrogen is of considerable interest to those seeking [[alternative energy|alternatives to fossil fuels]].<ref>Romm, J.R.

The PURE project on [[Unst]] in Shetland is a training and research centre that uses a combination of the ample supplies of wind power and fuel cells to create a [[Wind-Hydrogen Hybrid Power Systems|wind hydrogen]] system. Two 15&nbsp;kW turbines are attached to a 'Hypod' fuel cell, which in turn provides power for heating systems, the creation of stored liquid hydrogen and an innovative fuel-cell driven car.

== Local vs national concerns ==
[[File:Tattered Saltire2.jpg|thumb|right|"A battle that pitches environmentalists against conservationists."]]
A significant feature of Scotland's renewable potential is that the resources are largely distant from the main centres of population. This is by no means coincidental. The power of wind, wave and tide on the north and west coasts and for hydro in the mountains makes for dramatic scenery, but sometimes harsh living conditions.<ref>For example [[W. H. Murray]] described the [[Hebrides]] as "the Isles on the Edge of the Sea where men are welcomeâif they are hard in body and in spirit tenacious." Murray, W.H. (1966) ''The Hebrides''; London; Heinemann; page 232. Murray was born in 1913 and his use of the masculine may seem inappropriate now, although the harsh climate and lack of employment opportunities are very much an issue in the 21st century. See for example Ross, David (8 February 2007) "Western Isles set to pay its women to stay". ''The Herald'' which notes the local council's concerns about the long term decline in the population of women of childbearing age.</ref>

This happenstance of geography and climate has created various tensions. There is clearly a significant difference between a renewable energy production facility of modest size providing an island community with all its energy needs, and an industrial-scale power station in the same location that is designed to export power to far distant urban locations. Thus, plans for one of the world's largest onshore windfarms on the Hebridean [[Isle of Lewis]] have generated considerable debate.<ref name=Lewis>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_5205000/5205430.stm|title= Wind power dilemma for Lewis|work=BBC News|access-date=4 February 2007 | date=25 July 2006}}</ref> A related issue is the [[Energy policy of Scotland#Beauly-Denny power line|high-voltage BeaulyâDenny power line]] which brings electricity from renewable projects in the north and west to the cities of the south.<ref name=HICEC/> The matter went to a [[public inquiry]] and has been described by Ian Johnston of ''[[The Scotsman]]'' as a "battle that pitches environmentalists against conservationists and giant energy companies against aristocratic landowners and [[clan]] chiefs".<ref>Johnston, Ian (6 February 2007) [http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=193462007 "Scotland sits at a green crossroads"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031044356/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=193462007 |date=31 October 2007 }}.

(2006) ''Empowering Communities: A Step By Step Guide to Financing A Community Renewable Energy Project''. Inverness. HICEC</ref> For example, [[Alex Salmond]], the then [[First Minister of Scotland]], has stated that "we can think big by delivering small" and aspired to have a "million Scottish households with access to their own or community renewable generation within ten years".<ref name=SRF32/> The [[John Muir Trust]] has also stated that "the best renewable energy options around wild land are small-scale, sensitively sited and adjacent to the communities directly benefiting from them",<ref>''[http://www.jmt.org/news.asp?s=2&cat=Latest%20News&nid=JMT-N10035 What's Your View on Wild Land?]'' (2006) John Muir Trust.

See also {{cite web| url=http://www.jmt.org/responses-to-issues.asp| title=Renewable Energy Policy| publisher=John Muir Trust| access-date=31 August 2007}}</ref> although even community-owned schemes can prove controversial.<ref>For example, a small-scale scheme proposed by North Harris [[development trust]] has been supported by the [[John Muir Trust]], but opposed by Scottish Natural Heritage. The objection "caused outrage" and was withdrawn in September 2007. See Ross, David, (4 September 2007) "Heritage body in U-turn over island wind farm". Glasgow. ''The Herald''. The project finally received planning consent for three 86&nbsp;metre (282&nbsp;ft) wind turbines in early 2008. See "North Harris community wind farm approved" (February 2008) ''John Muir Trust Journal'' No. 44. Page 5.</ref>

A related issue is the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom. It has been alleged that UK transmission pricing structures are weighted against the development of renewables,<ref>Perry, David (22 November 2006) "Backing for North Sea Super-Grid plans". Aberdeen. ''Press and Journal''.</ref><ref>Dinning, R. J.

This report notes "we are aware this topic has been contentious amongst Scottish generators and apparently perverse in that it acts against renewable energy in the remote areas where it is most abundant (the same is true for shore access to areas in which CO<sub>2</sub> might be stored). However we have to observe the engineering logic surrounding the current regimeâthat generation be encouraged to deploy in areas, which avoid the wasted energy incurred in transmission losses". Nonetheless, Scottish Power has expressed concern that the current regime penalises the adoption of renewables.</ref><ref>Akildade, Anthony (11 February 2007) "Osborne steps into row over green targets". Glasgow. ''Sunday Herald''. This article outlines fears that subsidies for renewables will be targeted at offshore wind "which is more viable in England" than in Scotland where the technology "has yet to prove itself" because of the deeper waters off the coasts.</ref> a debate which highlights the contrast between the sparsely populated north of Scotland and the highly urbanised south and east of England. Although the [[ecological footprint]]s of Scotland and England are similar the relationship between this footprint and the [[Biocapacity|biocapacities]] of the respective countries are not. Scotland's biocapacity (a measure of the biologically productive area) is 4.52 [[global hectare]]s (gha) per head, some 15% less than the current ecological effect.<ref>Chambers, N. et al. (2004) ''Scotland's Footprint''. Oxford. Best Foot Forward.</ref> In other words, with a 15% reduction in consumption, the Scottish population could live within the productive capacity of the land to support them. However, the UK ecological footprint is more than three times the biocapacity, which is only 1.6 gha head, amongst the lowest in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/Ann1132753060|title=The Ecological Footprint: A resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere|publisher=European Environment Agency|access-date=4 February 2007}}</ref><ref>Global biocapacity averages 1.8 global hectares per person (excluding biodiversity considerations). Chambers (2004). Thus the UK is more typical than Scotland, which although having a high level of consumption, is relatively thinly populated.</ref> Thus, to achieve the same end in the UK context, consumption would have to be reduced by about 66%.

The [[developed country|developed world's]] economy is very dependent on 'point-source' fossil fuels. Scotland, as a relatively sparsely populated country with significant renewable resources, is in a unique position to demonstrate how the transition to a low-carbon, widely distributed energy economy may be undertaken. A balance will need to be struck between supporting this transition and providing exports to the economies of densely populated regions in the [[Central Belt]] and elsewhere, as they seek their own solutions. The tension between local and national needs in the Scottish context may therefore also play out on the wider UK and European stage.<ref>See, for example, Lowson, Mike (4 June 2007). "Halting the rush to blight Scotland's scenic landscape". Aberdeen. ''Press and Journal''.</ref>

== Promotion of renewables ==
Growing national concerns regarding [[peak oil]] and climate change have driven the subject of renewable energy high up the political agenda. Various public bodies and public-private partnerships have been created to develop the potential. The [[Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland]], (FREDS) is a partnership between industry, academia and government aimed at enabling Scotland to capitalise on its renewable energy resource. The Scottish Renewables Forum is an important intermediary organisation for the industry, hosting the annual ''Green Energy Awards''.
