Zuckerberg attended [[Harvard University]], where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]], and [[Chris Hughes]]. Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. As of March 2022, Zuckerberg's net worth was $74.5 billion according to the ''[[Forbes]]''{{'}} Real Time Billionaires.

=== Software development ===

==== Early years ====
Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in [[middle school]]. In high school, he built a program that allowed all the computers between his house and his father's dental office to communicate with each other.<ref>{{cite web |title=4-thing-mark-zuckerberg |url=http://www.letsintern.com/blog/4-thing-mark-zuckerberg/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422093404/http://www.letsintern.com/blog/4-thing-mark-zuckerberg/ |archive-date=April 22, 2016 |access-date=April 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-child-prodigy |url=http://learni.st/users/jacobrwheeler/boards/83006-facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-child-prodigy |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707143748/http://learni.st/users/jacobrwheeler/boards/83006-facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-child-prodigy |archive-date=July 7, 2015 |access-date=April 21, 2016}}</ref> During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player.

Mark created them."<ref name="NEWYORKER2010" />

==== College years ====
The ''New Yorker'' noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at [[Harvard]] in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy". He studied [[psychology]] and [[computer science]] and belonged to [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]] and [[Kirkland House]].<ref name="POTY" /><ref name="NEWYORKER2010" /><ref>{{citation |last=Larson |first=Chase |title=Mark Zuckerberg speaks at BYU, calls Facebook "as much psychology and sociology as it is technology" |date=March 25, 2011 |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700121651/Mark-Zuckerberg-speaks-at-BYU-calls-Facebook-as-much-psychology-and-sociology-as-it-is-technology.html |work=Deseret News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427061627/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700121651/Mark-Zuckerberg-speaks-at-BYU-calls-Facebook-as-much-psychology-and-sociology-as-it-is-technology.html |access-date=May 21, 2012 |archive-date=April 27, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> In his [[sophomore]] year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called [[History of Facebook#FaceMash|Facemash]] that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained:

<blockquote>We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.<ref name="Hasit">{{cite web |last=Grimland |first=Guy |date=October 5, 2009 |title=Facebook founder's roommate recounts creation of Internet giant |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/facebook-founder-s-roommate-recounts-creation-of-internet-giant-1.275748 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022153118/http://www.haaretz.com/news/facebook-founder-s-roommate-recounts-creation-of-internet-giant-1.275748 |archive-date=October 22, 2010 |access-date=December 14, 2010 |work=Haaretz}}</ref></blockquote>

The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's [[network switch]]es and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper".<ref name="Hasit" />

The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.<ref name="Hoffman, Claire2">{{Cite magazine |last=Hoffman |first=Claire |date=June 28, 2008 |title=The Battle for Facebook |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |url-status=dead |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York City |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703220456/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |archive-date=July 3, 2008 |access-date=February 5, 2009}}</ref> On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com, in partnership with his roommates [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]], and [[Chris Hughes]].<ref name="skepticism2">{{Cite news |author=Seward, Zachary M. |date=July 25, 2007 |title=Judge Expresses Skepticism About Facebook Lawsuit |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York City |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118539991204578084 |url-status=live |access-date=April 30, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055244/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118539991204578084.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |archive-date=September 21, 2013}}</ref><ref name="rww051009">{{cite web |last=Antonas |first=Steffan |date=May 10, 2009 |title=Did Mark Zuckerberg's Inspiration for Facebook Come Before Harvard? |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mark_zuckerberg_inspiration_for_facebook_before_harvard.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201185222/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mark_zuckerberg_inspiration_for_facebook_before_harvard.php |archive-date=February 1, 2012 |access-date=March 26, 2013 |work=ReadWrite Social |publisher=SAY Media, Inc}}</ref><ref name="Exeter">{{cite web |date=January 24, 2007 |title=Face-to-Face with Mark Zuckerberg '02 |url=http://www.exeter.edu/news_and_events/news_events_5594.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202181919/http://www.exeter.edu/news_and_events/news_events_5594.aspx |archive-date=February 2, 2012 |access-date=March 26, 2013 |work=Phillips Exeter Academy |publisher=Phillips Exeter Academy}}</ref> An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.<ref name="rww051009" />

Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]], accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called [[ConnectU|HarvardConnection.com]], while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.<ref name="zuckerberghacked2">{{Cite news |last=Carlson |first=Nicolas |date=March 5, 2010 |title=In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account |magazine=[[Business Insider]] |location=New York City |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |url-status=live |access-date=March 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508193810/https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |archive-date=May 8, 2019}}</ref> The three complained to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', and the newspaper began an investigation in response.

Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could "learn how to better serve the community".<ref name="Tad">{{cite news |author1=Maria Tadeo |title=Mark Zuckerberg Q&A: What we learnt about the Facebook founder |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mark-zuckerberg-qa-what-we-learnt-about-the-facebook-founder-9921582.html |access-date=December 14, 2014 |work=The Independent |date=December 12, 2014 |archive-date=December 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221074735/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mark-zuckerberg-qa-what-we-learnt-about-the-facebook-founder-9921582.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Sam">{{cite magazine |author1=Sam Colt |title=Facebook May Be Adding a 'Dislike' Button |url=http://www.inc.com/business-insider/Facebook-may-be-adding-a-dislike-button.html?cid=em01011week50day12d |magazine=Inc. |publisher=Monsueto Ventures |access-date=December 14, 2014 |date=December 12, 2014 |archive-date=March 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320064745/http://www.inc.com/business-insider/Facebook-may-be-adding-a-dislike-button.html?cid=em01011week50day12d |url-status=live}}</ref>

A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, [[i2hub]], another campus-only service, created by [[Wayne Chang]], was launched. i2hub focused on [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing.

In 2013, Zuckerberg launched [[Internet.org]], which he described as an initiative to provide Internet access to the five billion people without it as of the launch date. The project faced significant opposition in India, where activists said its limited internet ran counter to the principle of [[net neutrality]]; Zuckerberg responded that a limited internet was better than no internet.

In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood [[pellet fuel]] company in [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County, upstate New York]], filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was ''Facemash'', the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name ''thefacebook.com'' until January 1, 2004. Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as "completely frivolous". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellsvilledaily.com/article/20100729/NEWS/307299940 |title=Facebook does not have a like button for Ceglia |author=Anderson, John |publisher=WellsvilleDaily.com |date=July 29, 2010 |access-date=August 29, 2010 |archive-date=March 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330113101/http://www.wellsvilledaily.com/article/20100729/News/307299940 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/07/20/zuckerberg-ceglia|title=Venture beat coverage of Ceglia lawsuit|date=July 20, 2010|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-date=December 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202164414/https://venturebeat.com/2010/07/20/zuckerberg-ceglia/|url-status=live}}</ref>

He says that "a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false", and concludes that primarily "his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet".<ref name="BBCmovie">Rohrer, Finlo.

Although the film portrayed Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite [[Officially unrecognized Harvard College social clubs|final clubs]] at Harvard, Zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs.<ref name="NEWYORKER2010" /> Kirkpatrick agreed that the impression implied by the film is "false". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, noted that the "image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated&nbsp;... It is fiction&nbsp;..." He likewise dismissed the film's assertion that he "would deliberately betray a friend."<ref name=BBCmovie />

On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten "[[Black Lives Matter]]" phrases on the company walls and had written "All Lives Matter" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but "malicious as well." According to Zuckerberg's memo, "''Black Lives Matter'' doesn't mean other lives don't – it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve." The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself, "means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's." Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents.<ref name="shaunking-zuckerberg">{{cite news |last1=King |first1=Shaun |title=Mark Zuckerberg forced to address racism among Facebook staff after vandals target Black Lives Matter phrases |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-mark-zuckerberg-forced-address-racism-facebook-article-1.2543985 |access-date=February 26, 2016 |agency=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York |date=February 25, 2016 |archive-date=February 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202025559/https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-mark-zuckerberg-forced-address-racism-facebook-article-1.2543985 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="guynn">{{cite news |last1=Jessica |first1=Guynn |title=Zuckerberg reprimands Facebook staff defacing 'Black Lives Matter' slogan |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/25/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter-diversity/80933694/ |access-date=February 26, 2016 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=February 25, 2016 |archive-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318170616/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/25/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter-diversity/80933694/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="benjaminsnyder">{{cite news |last1=Snyder |first1=Benjamin |title=Mark Zuckerberg Takes Facebook Workers to Task Over 'All Lives Matter' Graffiti |url=http://fortune.com/2016/02/25/mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter/ |access-date=February 26, 2016 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=February 25, 2016 |archive-date=February 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225220147/http://fortune.com/2016/02/25/mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter/ |url-status=live }}</ref> New York's ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that, "Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure."<ref name="shaunking-zuckerberg"/>
