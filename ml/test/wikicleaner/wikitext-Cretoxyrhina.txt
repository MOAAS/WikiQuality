'''''Cretoxyrhina''''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|ɪ|ˌ|t|ɒ|k|s|i|ˈ|r|h|aɪ|n|ə}}; meaning 'Cretaceous sharp-nose') is an extinct [[genus]] of large [[Lamniformes|mackerel shark]] that lived about 107 to 73 million years ago during the late [[Albian]] to late [[Campanian]] of the [[Late Cretaceous]]. The [[type species]], ''C. mantelli'', is more commonly referred to as the '''Ginsu shark''', first popularized in reference to the [[Ginsu knife]], as its theoretical feeding mechanism is often compared with the "slicing and dicing" when one uses the knife. ''Cretoxyrhina'' is traditionally classified as the likely sole member of the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Cretoxyrhinidae''' but other taxonomic placements have been proposed, such as within the [[Alopiidae]] and [[Lamnidae]].

<!--If you are here to "correct" the statement that Cretoxyrhina measures up to 8 meters, please don't. 8 meters is a scientifically verified length (ref. 10).-->
Measuring up to {{convert|8|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in length and weighing over {{convert|4944|kg|ton|sp=us}}, ''Cretoxyrhina'' was one of the largest sharks of its time. Having a similar appearance and build to the modern [[great white shark]], it was an [[apex predator]] in its ecosystem and preyed on a large variety of marine animals including [[mosasaur]]s and [[plesiosaurs]], sharks and other large fish, [[pterosaur]]s, and occasionally [[dinosaurs]]. Its teeth, up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|sp=us}} in height, were razor-like and had thick [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] built for stabbing and slicing prey. ''Cretoxyrhina'' was also among the fastest-swimming sharks, with hydrodynamic calculations suggesting burst speed capabilities of up to {{convert|70|km/h|mi/h|sp=us}}.{{efn|name=speedcaveat}} It has been speculated that ''Cretoxyrhina'' hunted by lunging at its prey at high speeds to inflict powerful blows, similar to the great white shark today, and relied on strong eyesight to do so.

Since the late 19th century, several fossils of exceptionally well-preserved skeletons of ''Cretoxyrhina'' have been discovered in Kansas. Studies have successfully calculated its life history using vertebrae from some of the skeletons. ''Cretoxyrhina'' grew rapidly during early ages and reached sexual maturity at around four to five years of age. Its lifespan has been calculated to extend to nearly forty years. Anatomical analysis of the ''Cretoxyrhina'' skeletons revealed that the shark possessed facial and optical features most similar to that in [[thresher shark]]s and [[crocodile shark]]s and had a hydrodynamic build that suggested the use of [[Endotherm#Regional endothermy|regional endothermy]].

As an apex predator, ''Cretoxyrhina'' played a critical role in the marine ecosystems it inhabited. It was a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] genus and its fossils have been found worldwide, although most frequently in the [[Western Interior Seaway]] area of North America. It preferred mainly subtropical to temperate pelagic environments but was known in waters as cold as {{convert|5|C|F|sp=us}}. ''Cretoxyrhina'' saw its peak in size by the [[Coniacian]], but subsequently experienced a continuous decline until its extinction during the Campanian. One factor in this demise may have been increasing pressure from competition with predators that arose around the same time, most notably the giant mosasaur ''[[Tylosaurus]]''. Other possible factors include the gradual disappearance of the [[Western Interior Seaway]].

''Cretoxyrhina'' was first [[species description|described]] by the [[England|English]] paleontologist [[Gideon Mantell]] from eight ''C. mantelli'' teeth he collected from the [[Southerham Grey Pit]] near [[Lewes]], [[East Sussex]].<ref name=Amalfitanoetal /> In his 1822 book ''The fossils of the South Downs'', he identified them as teeth pertaining to two species of locally-known modern sharks. Mantell identified the smaller teeth as from the [[common smooth-hound]] and the larger teeth as from the [[smooth hammerhead]], expressing some hesitation to the latter.<ref name=Mantell1822>{{cite book|author1=Gideon Mantell|author2=Mary Ann Mantell|title=The fossils of the South Downs; or illustrations of the geology of Sussex|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_pKhAAAAAcAAJ|year=1822|publisher=Lupton Relfe|doi=10.3931/e-rara-16021}}</ref> In 1843, [[Switzerland|Swiss]] naturalist [[Louis Agassiz]] published the third volume of his book ''Recherches sur les poissons fossiles'', where he reexamined Mantell's eight teeth. Using them and another tooth from the collection of the Strasbourg Museum (whose exact location was unspecified but also came from England), he concluded that the fossils actually pertained to a single species of extinct shark that held strong dental similarities with the three species then classified in the now-invalid genus ''[[Oxyrhina]]'', ''O. hastalis'', ''O. xiphodon'', and ''O. desorii''.<ref name=Agassiz1843>{{cite book|author=Louis Agassiz|title=Recherches sur les poissons fossiles|volume=3|publisher=[[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]|language=fr|year=1833–1843|orig-year=1838|url=https://archive.org/details/recherchessurles03agas}}</ref>{{efn|These are now identified as ''Cosmopolitodus hastalis'' and ''Isurus desori'';<ref name=Hungary>{{cite journal|author=László Kocsis|title=Central Paratethyan shark fauna (Ipolytarnóc, Hungary)|year=2009|journal=Geologica Carpathica|volume=58|issue=1|pages=27–40|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228346892|access-date=2018-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125073925/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228346892_Central_Paratethyan_shark_fauna_Ipolytarnoc_Hungary|archive-date=2018-11-25|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Oxyrhina xiphodon'' is now considered conspecific with ''Cosmopolitodus hastalis''.<ref name = Ward>{{cite journal|title=Additions to and a review of the Miocene Shark and Ray fauna of Malta.|journal=The Central Mediterranean Naturalist|volume=3|issue=3|pages=131–146|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280316614}}</ref>}} Agassiz placed the species in the genus ''Oxyrhina'' but noted that the much thicker root of its teeth made enough of a difference to be a distinct species and scientifically classified the shark under the taxon ''Oxyrhina mantellii''&thinsp;{{efn|The original spelling made by Agassiz ended with -ii.

During the late 19th century, paleontologists described numerous species that are now synonymized as ''Cretoxyrhina mantelli''. According to some, there may have been as much as almost 30 different synonyms of ''O. mantelli'' at the time.<ref name=BigShark>{{cite web|author=Mike Everhart|title=A Giant Ginsu Shark|year=2002|website=Oceans of Kansas|url=http://oceansofkansas.com/bigshark.html|access-date=2018-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111000345/http://oceansofkansas.com/bigshark.html|archive-date=2018-11-11|url-status=live}}</ref> Most of these species were derived from teeth that represented variations of ''C. mantelli'' but deviated from the exact characteristics of the [[syntype]]s.<ref name=Eastman1894 /> For example, in 1870, [[France|French]] paleontologist Henri Sauvage identified teeth from France that greatly resembled the ''O. mantelli'' syntypes from England. The teeth also included [[Anatomical terms of location#medial and lateral|lateral]] cusplets (small enameled [[cusp (anatomy)|cusps]] that appear at the base of the tooth's main crown), which are not present in the syntypes, which led him to describe the teeth under the species name ''Otodus oxyrinoides'' based on the lateral cusplets.<ref name=Bourdon>{{cite web|author=Jim Bourdon|title=Cretoxyrhina|url=http://www.elasmo.com/frameMe.html?file=genera/cretaceous/cretoxyrhina.html&menu=bin/menu_genera-alt.html|access-date=2018-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111004733/http://www.elasmo.com/frameMe.html?file=genera%2Fcretaceous%2Fcretoxyrhina.html&menu=bin%2Fmenu_genera-alt.html|archive-date=2018-11-11|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1873, [[United States of America|American]] paleontologist [[Joseph Leidy]] identified teeth from [[Kansas]] and [[Mississippi]] and described them under the species name ''Oxyrhina extenta''.

This all changed with the discoveries of some exceptionally well-preserved skeletons of the shark in the [[Niobrara Formation]] in West Kansas. [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg|Charles H. Sternberg]] discovered the first skeleton in 1890, which he described in a 1907 paper:<ref name=BigShark />
{{Blockquote|text= The remarkable thing about this specimen is that the vertebral column, though of cartilaginous material, was almost complete, and that the large number of 250 teeth were in position. When Chas. R. Eastman, of Harvard, described this specimen, it proved so complete as to destroy nearly thirty synonyms used to name the animal, and derived from many teeth found in former times.

[[Charles R. Eastman]] published his analysis of the skeleton in 1894. In the paper, he reconstructed the dentition based on the skeleton's disarticulated tooth set. Using the reconstruction, Eastman identified the many extinct shark species and found that their fossils are actually different tooth types of ''O. mantelli'', which he all moved into the species.<ref name=Bourdon /><ref name=Eastman1894 /> This skeleton, which Sternberg had sold to the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], was destroyed in 1944 by allied bombing during [[World War II]].<ref name=Bourdon /><ref name=BigShark /> In 1891, Sternberg's son [[George F.

This skeleton was reported to measure {{convert|20|ft|m|order=flip|sp=us}} in length and consists of a partial vertebral column with skeletal remains of a ''[[Xiphactinus]]'' as stomach contents and partial jaws with about 150 teeth visible. This skeleton was considered to be one of the greatest scientific discoveries of that year due to the unexpected preservation of cartilage.<ref name=BigShark /> George F.

===Etymology===
''Cretoxyrhina'' is a portmanteau of the word ''creto'' (short for ''[[Cretaceous]]'') prefixed to the genus ''Oxyrhina'', which is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ὀξύς (oxús, "sharp") and ῥίς (rhís, "nose"). When put together they mean "Cretaceous sharp-nose", although ''Cretoxyrhina'' is believed to have had a rather blunt snout.<ref name = ShimadaSkeletal /> The type species name ''mantelli'' translates to "from Mantell", which Louis Agassiz named in honor of English paleontologist Gideon Mantell for supplying him the syntypes of the species.<ref name=Agassiz1843 /> The species name ''denticulata'' is derived from the Latin word ''denticulus'' (small tooth) and suffix ''āta'' (possession of), together meaning "having small teeth". This is a reference to the appearance of lateral cusplets in most of the teeth in ''C. denticulata''.<ref name=GlickmanDenticulata /> The species ''vraconensis'' derived from the word ''vracon'' and the Latin ''ensis'' (from), meaning "from Vracon", which is a reference to the [[Albian#Stratigraphic definitions|Vraconian]] substage of the Albian stage in which the species was discovered.<ref name = ZhelezkoRussian /> The species name ''agassizensis'' is derived from the name ''Agassiz'' and the Latin ''ensis'' (from), meaning "from Agassiz", named after Lake Agassiz where the species was discovered.<ref name=Underwood /> Coincidentally, the lake itself is named in honor of Louis Agassiz.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Upham |first1=Warren |title=The Geology of Central and Western Minnesota.

''Cretoxyrhina'' contains four valid species: ''C. vraconensis'', ''C. denticulata'', ''C. agassizensis'', and ''C. mantelli''. These species represent a [[chronospecies]].<ref name=Amalfitanoetal /> The earliest fossils of ''Cretoxyrhina'' are dated about 107 million years old and belong to ''C. vraconensis''.<ref name=Ward2009 /> The genus would progress by ''C. vraconensis'' evolving into ''C. denticulata'' during the Early [[Cenomanian]] which evolved into ''C. agassizensis'' during the Mid-Cenomanian which in turn evolved into ''C. mantelli'' during the Late-Cenomanian. It is notable that ''C. agassizensis'' continued until the Mid-[[Turonian]] and was briefly contemporaneous with ''C. mantelli''.<ref name=Amalfitanoetal /> This progression was characterized by the reduction of lateral cusplets and the increasing size and robustness of teeth.<ref name= SiversonandLindgren /><ref name=Wilson>{{cite journal|author=Mark Wilson, Mark V.H.

However, the Horseshoe Canyon Formation has only [[brackish water]] deposits despite ''Cretoxyrhina'' being a marine shark, making a likely possibility that the fossil was [[Fossil#Derived, or reworked|reworked]] from an older layer.<ref name=Larsonetal />

Phylogenetic studies through morphological data conducted by Shimada in 2005 suggested that ''Cretoxyrhina'' may alternatively be congeneric with the genus of the modern [[thresher shark]]s; the study also stated that the results are premature and may be inaccurate and recommended that ''Cretoxyrhina'' is kept within the family Cretoxyrhinidae, mainly citing the lack of substantial data for it during the analysis.<ref name = ShimadaPhylo />

Another possible model for ''Cretoxyrhina'' evolution, proposed in 2014 by paleontologist Cajus Diedrich, suggests that ''C. mantelli'' was congeneric with the [[mako shark]]s of the genus ''[[Isurus]]'' and was part of an extended ''Isurus'' lineage beginning as far the [[Aptian]] stage in the Early Cretaceous. According to this model, the ''Isurus'' lineage was initiated by '' 'Isurus appendiculatus' '' (''Cretolamna appendiculata''), which evolved into ''Isurus denticulatus'' (''Cretoxyrhina mantelli''&thinsp;<ref name=Amalfitanoetal />) in the Mid-Cenomanian, then '' 'Isurus mantelli' '' (''Cretoxyrhina mantelli''&thinsp;) at the beginning of the Coniacian, then ''Isurus schoutedenti'' during the [[Paleocene]], then ''Isurus praecursor'', where the rest of the ''Isurus'' lineage continues.{{efn|'' 'Isurus appendiculatus' '' and '' 'Isurus mantelli' '' are scientific names proposed and used by Diedrich (2014). The original and more widely accepted scientific names of these taxa are shown in parenthesis.<ref name=Diedrich />}} The study claimed that the absence of corresponding fossils during the Maastrichtian (72–66 Ma) was not a result of a premature extinction of ''C. mantelli'', but merely a gap in the fossil record.<ref name=Diedrich /> Shimada and fellow paleontologist Phillip Sternes published a poster in 2018 which voiced doubt over the credibility of this proposal, noting that the study's interpretation is largely based on data that had been arbitrarily selected and failed to cite either Shimada (1997){{efn|Shimada (1997) is cited in Diedrich (2014); the latter failed to use the citation in any of his claims regarding the systematic placement of ''C. mantelli'', using it only in stratigraphic and historical notes.<ref name=Diedrich />}} or Shimada (2005), which are key papers regarding the systematic position of ''C. mantelli''.<ref name=SternesandShimada />

====Dentition====
[[File:Cretoxyrhina mantelli dental reconstruction.png|thumb|upright=2|alt=Illustration of the teeth inside a jaw of ''C. mantelli''|Reconstruction of the dentition of ''C. mantelli'']]
Distinguishing characteristics of ''Cretoxyrhina'' teeth include a nearly symmetrical or slanted triangular shape, razor-like and non-serrated cutting edges, visible tooth necks (bourlette), and a thick enamel coating. The dentition of ''Cretoxyrhina'' possesses the basic dental characteristics of a [[lamniformes|mackerel shark]], with tooth rows closely spaced without any overlap. Anterior teeth are straight and near-symmetrical, while lateroposterior teeth are slanted. The side of the tooth facing the mouth is convex and possesses massive protuberance and nutrient grooves on the root, whereas the labial side, which faces outwards, is flat or slightly swollen.<ref name=ShimadaDentition /> Juveniles possessed lateral cusplets in all teeth,<ref name=Underwood /> and ''C. vraconensis'' consistently retained them in adulthood.<ref name=SiversonVracon /> Lateral cusplets were retained only up to all lateroposterior teeth in adulthood in ''C. denticulata'' and ''C. agassizensis'' and only up to the back lateroposterior teeth in ''C. mantelli''.<ref name=Underwood /> The lateral cusplets of ''C. vraconensis''<ref name=SiversonVracon /> and ''C. denticulata'' are round, while in ''C. agassizensis'' are sharpened to a point.<ref name=Amalfitanoetal /> The anterior teeth of ''C. vraconensis'' measure {{convert|2.1–3.5|cm|in|1|sp=us}} in height,<ref name= SiversonVracon /> while the largest known tooth of ''C. denticulata'' measures {{convert|3|cm|in|1|sp=us}}.<ref name=Underwood /> ''C. mantelli'' teeth are larger, measuring {{convert|3–4|cm|in|0|sp=us}} in average slant height. The largest tooth discovered from this species may have measured up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|sp=us}}.<ref name = Newbrey />

The dentition of ''C. mantelli'' is among the best-known of all extinct sharks, thanks to fossil skeletons like FHSM VP-2187, which consists of a near-complete articulated dentition. Other ''C. mantelli'' skeletons, such as KUVP-247 and KUVP-69102, also include partial jaws with some teeth in their natural positions, some of which were not present in more complete skeletons like FHSM VP-2187. Using these specimens, the dental formula was reconstructed by Shimada (1997) and revised by Shimada (2002), it was {{DentalFormula|upper=S4.A2.I4.LP11(+?)|lower=s1?.a2.i1.lp15(+?)}}. This means that from front to back, ''C. mantelli'' had: four symphysials (small teeth located in the symphysis of a jaw), two anteriors, four intermediates, and eleven or more lateroposteriors for the upper jaw and possibly one symphysial, two anteriors, one intermediate, and fifteen or more lateroposteriors for the lower jaw. The structure of the tooth row shows a dental structure suited for a feeding behavior similar to modern mako sharks, having large spear-like anteriors to stab and anchor prey and curved lateroposteriors to cut it to bite-size pieces,<ref name=ShimadaDentition /><ref name=Shimada2002Dental>{{cite journal|author=Kenshu Shimada|title=Dental homologies in lamniform sharks (Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii)|journal=Journal of Morphology|year=2002|volume=251|issue=1|pages=38–72|doi=10.1002/jmor.1073|pmid=11746467|s2cid=22195080}}</ref> a mechanism often informally described as "slicing and dicing" by paleontologists.<ref name="Ginsu" /> In 2011, paleontologists Jim Bourdon and Mike Everhart reconstructed the dentition of multiple ''C. mantelli'' individuals based on their associated tooth sets. They discovered that two of these reconstructions show some notable differences in the size of the first intermediate (I1) tooth and lateral profiles, concluding that these differences could possibly represent [[sexual dimorphism]] or individual variations.<ref name=BourdonAndEverhart>{{cite journal|author=Jim Bourdon and Michael Everhart|title=Analysis of an associated Cretoxyrhina mantelli dentition from the Late Cretaceous (Smoky Hill Chalk, Late Coniacian) of western Kansas|year=2011|journal=Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science|volume=114|issue=1–2|pages=15–32|url=http://www.elasmo.com/refs/pdf/bourdon-everhart2011.pdf|doi=10.1660/062.114.0102|s2cid=56237457|access-date=2018-12-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404233212/http://www.elasmo.com/refs/pdf/bourdon-everhart2011.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Skull====
Analysis of skull and scale patterns suggests that ''C. mantelli'' had a conical head with a dorsally flat and wide skull. The [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] does not extend much forward from the frontal margin of the braincase, suggesting that the snout was blunt.<ref name = ShimadaSkeletal /> Similar to modern [[crocodile shark]]s and thresher sharks, ''C. mantelli'' had proportionally large eyes, with the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] roughly taking up one-third of the entire skull length, giving it acute vision. As a predator, good eyesight was important when hunting the large prey ''Cretoxyrhina'' fed on. In contrast, the more smell-reliant contemporaneous [[Anacoracidae|anacoracid]] ''[[Squalicorax]]''{{'}}s less advanced orbital but stronger [[Olfaction|olfactory processes]] was more suitable for an opportunistic [[scavenger]].<ref name = ShimadaSkeletal /><ref name=ShimadaCicimurri>{{cite journal|author=Kenshu Shimada and David J.

The jaws of ''C. mantelli'' were kinetically powerful. They have a slightly looser anterior curvature and a more robust build than that of the modern mako sharks, but otherwise were similar in general shape. The [[hyomandibula]] is elongated and was believed to swing laterally, which would allow jaw protrusion and deep biting.<ref name = ShimadaSkeletal />

====Skeletal anatomy====
Most species of ''Cretoxyrhina'' are represented only by fossil teeth and vertebra. Like all sharks, the skeleton of ''Cretoxyrhina'' was made of [[cartilage]], which is less capable of fossilization than [[bone]]. However, fossils of ''C. mantelli'' from the Niobrara Formation have been found exceptionally preserved;<ref name=SharksofKansas>{{Cite web|author=Mike Everhart|title=Sharks of Kansas|url=http://oceansofkansas.com/KS-sharks.html|website=Oceans of Kansas|access-date=2018-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902081044/http://oceansofkansas.com/KS-sharks.html|archive-date=2018-09-02|url-status=live}}</ref> this was due to the formation's chalk having high contents of [[calcium]], allowing [[calcification]] to become more prevalent.<ref name=NiobraraGeology>{{cite thesis|author=Denton Lee O’Neal|title=Chemostratigraphic and depositional characterization of the Niobrara Formation, Cemex Quarry, Lyons, CO|url=https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/11124/17096/ONeal_mines_0052N_10689.pdf|publisher=Colorado School of Mines|year=2015|access-date=2018-11-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111000138/https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/11124/17096/ONeal_mines_0052N_10689.pdf|archive-date=2018-11-11|url-status=live}}</ref> When calcified, soft tissue hardens, making it more prone to fossilization.<ref name=SharksofKansas />

Numerous skeletons consisting of near-complete vertebral columns have been found. The largest vertebra were measured up to {{convert|87|mm|in|0|sp=us}} in diameter. Two specimens with the best-preserved vertebral columns (FHSM VP-2187 and KUVP 69102) have 218 and 201 centra, respectively, and nearly all vertebra in the column preserved; only portions of the tail tip are missing for both. Estimations of tail length calculates a total vertebral count of approximately 230 centra, which is unique as all known extant mackerel sharks possess a vertebral count of either less than 197 or greater than 282 with none in between. The vertebral centra in the trunk region were large and circular, creating an overall spindle-shaped body with a stocky trunk.<ref name = ShimadaSkeletal />

An analysis of a partially complete tail fin fossil shows that ''Cretoxyrhina'' had a lunate (crescent-shaped) tail most similar with modern lamnid sharks, [[whale shark]]s, and [[basking shark]]s. The transition to tail vertebrae is estimated to be between the 140th and 160th vertebrae out of the total 230, resulting in a total tail vertebral count of 70–90 and making up approximately 30–39% of the vertebral column. The transition from precaudal (the set of vertebrae before the tail vertebrae) to tail vertebrae is also marked by a vertebral bend of about 45°, which is the highest possible angle known in extant sharks and is mostly found in fast-swimming sharks, such as lamnids.<ref name="CFS">{{Cite journal|author=Kenshu Shimada, Stephen L.

===Life history===
====Reproduction====
Although no fossil evidence for it has been found, it is inferred that ''Cretoxyrhina'' was [[ovivipary|ovoviviparous]] as all modern mackerel sharks are. In ovoviviparous sharks, young are hatched and grow inside the mother while competing against litter-mates through cannibalism such as [[oophagy]] (egg eating). As ''Cretoxyrhina'' inhabited [[oligotrophic]] and pelagic waters where predators such as large mosasaurs like ''Tylosaurus'' and macropredatory fish like ''Xiphactinus'' were common, it is likely that it also was an [[r-selected]] shark, where many infants are produced to offset high infant mortality rates. Similarly, pelagic sharks such as the great white shark, thresher sharks, mako sharks, [[porbeagle|porbeagle shark]], and crocodile shark produce two to nine infants per litter.<ref name = ShimadaGrowth />

====Growth and longevity====

Portions of the vertebral column from FHSM VP-2187 '''C.''' Vertebral centrum from ''C. mantelli'' '''D1-D2.''' Vertebral centrum from ''C. agassizensis'' '''E.''' Associated centra of ''C. cf. agassizensis'']]
Like all mackerel sharks, ''Cretoxyrhina'' grew a growth ring in its vertebrae every year and is aged through measuring each band; due to the rarity of well-preserved vertebrae, only a few ''Cretoxyrhina'' individuals have been aged. In Shimada (1997), a linear equation for calculating the total body length of ''Cretoxyrhina'' using the centrum (the body of a vertebra) diameter of a vertebra was developed and is shown below, with {{var|TL}} representing total body length and {{var|CD}} representing centrum diameter (the diameter of each band).<ref name = ShimadaGrowth />

{{math|big=1|''TL'' {{=}} 0.281 + 5.746''CD''}}

Using this linear equation, measurements were first conducted on the best-preserved ''C. mantelli'' specimen, FHSM VP-2187, by Shimada (2008). The measurements showed a length of {{convert|1.28|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and weight of about {{convert|16.3|kg|lbs|0|sp=us}} at birth, and rapid growth in the first two years of life, doubling the length within 3.3 years. From then on, size growth became steady and gradual, growing a mean estimate of {{convert|21.1|cm|in|0|sp=us}} per year until its death at around 15 years of age, at which it had grown to {{convert|5|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. Using the [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy#Individual growth model|von Bertalanffy growth model]] on FHSM VP-2187, the maximum lifespan of ''C. mantelli'' was estimated to be 38.2 years. By that age, it would have grown over {{convert|7|m|ft|0|sp=us}} long. Based on allometric scaling of a great white shark, Shimada found that such individual would have weighed as much as {{convert|3400|kg|ton|sp=us}}.<ref name = ShimadaGrowth />

A remeasurement conducted by Newbrey et al. (2013) found that ''C. mantelli'' and ''C. agassizensis'' reached sexual maturity at around four to five years of age and proposed a possible revision to the measurements of the growth rings in FHSM VP-2187. The lifespan of FHSM VP-2187 and maximum lifespan of ''C. mantelli'' was also proposed to be revised to 18 and 21 years respectively using the new measurements. A 2019 study led by Italian scientist Jacopo Amalfitano briefly measured the vertebrae from two ''C. mantelli'' fossils and found that the older individual died at around 26 years of age.<ref name=Amalfitanoetal /> Measurements were also conducted on other ''C. mantelli'' skeletons and a vertebra of ''C. agassizensis'', yielding results of similar rates of rapid growth in early stages of life.<ref name = Newbrey /> Such rapid growth within mere years could have helped ''Cretoxyrhina'' better survive by quickly phasing out of infancy and its vulnerabilities, as a fully grown adult would have few natural predators.<ref name = ShimadaGrowth /> The study also identified a syntype tooth of ''C. mantelli'' from England and calculated the individual's maximum length of {{convert|8|m|ft|sp=us}}, making the tooth the largest known specimen yet.<ref name= Newbrey />{{efn|This syntype is in the collection of the British Museum of Natural History cataloged as NHMUK PV OR 4498.<ref name=NHMUKsyntype>{{cite web|title=PV OR 4498|website=Natural History Museum Specimen Collection|date=2009-01-07|url=http://data.nhm.ac.uk/object/b18311d8-1722-4ae7-ae72-41ccd3e046b0|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref> This was not mentioned in Newbrey et al.

Although ''Cretoxyrhina'' was mainly an active hunter, it was also an opportunistic feeder and may have scavenged from time to time.

===Hunting strategies===

The hunting strategies of ''Cretoxyrhina'' are not well documented because many fossils with ''Cretoxyrhina'' feeding marks cannot be distinguished between predation or scavenging. If they were indeed a result of the former, that would mean that ''Cretoxyrhina'' most likely employed hunting strategies involving a main powerful and fatal blow similar to [[Aquatic feeding mechanisms|ram feeding]] seen in modern [[Carcharhinidae|requiem sharks]] and lamnids. A 2004 study by shark experts Vittorio Gabriotti and Alessandro De Maddalena observed that the modern great white shark reaching lengths of greater than {{convert|4|m|sp=us}} commonly ram its prey with massive velocity and strength to inflict single fatal blows, sometimes so powerful that prey would be propelled out of the water by the impact's force. As ''Cretoxyrhina'' possessed a robust stocky build capable of fast swimming, powerful kinetic jaws like the great white shark, and reaches lengths similar to or greater than it, a hunting style like this would be likely.<ref name=EverhartElasmosaurus />

''Cretoxyrhina'' inhabited mainly temperate to subtropical pelagic oceans.

===Competition===

occupied a similar ecological role with ''Cretoxyrhina'' such as the [[Cardabiodontidae|cardabiodontids]] ''[[Cardabiodon]]''<ref name=Newbrey /> and ''[[Dwardius]]'', the latter showing evidence of direct competition with ''C. vraconensis'' based on intricate distribution patterns between the two.<ref name=SiversonandMachalski />

A 2010 study by paleontologists Corinne Myers and Bruce Lieberman on competition in the Western Interior Seaway used quantitative analytical techniques based on [[Geographical information system]]s and tectonic reconstructions to reconstruct the hypothetical competitive relationships between ten of the most prevalent and abundant marine vertebrates of the region, including ''Cretoxyrhina''. Their calculations found negative correlations between the distribution of ''Cretoxyrhina'' and the three potential competitors ''Squalicorax kaupi'', ''Tylosaurus proriger'', and ''Platecarpus spp.''; a statistically significant negative correlation implies that the distribution of one species was affected due to being outcompeted by another. However, none of the relationships were statistically significant, which instead indicates that the trends were unlikely the result of competition.<ref name=MyersandLieberman>{{cite journal|author=Corinne Myers and Bruce Lieberman|title=Sharks that pass in the night: using Geographical Information Systems to investigate competition in the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway|year=2010|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=278|issue=1706|pages=681–689|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.1617|pmid=20843852|pmc=3030853}}</ref>

===Extinction===
[[File:Bunker Tylosaur.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Skeleton of ''Tylosaurus proriger'' from the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia|Increasing pressure from competition with predators like ''[[Tylosaurus]]'' may have contributed to the decline and extinction of ''Cretoxyrhina''.]]
The causes of the extinction of ''Cretoxyrhina'' are uncertain. What is known is that it declined slowly over millions of years.<ref name=SiversonandLindgren /> Since its peak in size during the Coniacian, the size<ref name=ShimadaStrat /> and distribution<ref name=SiversonandLindgren /> of ''Cretoxyrhina'' fossils gradually declined until its eventual demise during the Campanian.<ref name=ShimadaStrat /> Siverson and Lindgren (2005) noted that the age of the youngest fossils of ''Cretoxyrhina'' differed between continents. In Australia, the youngest ''Cretoxyrhina'' fossils were dated approximately 83 Ma during the Santonian, while the youngest North American fossils known at the time (which were dated in the Early Campanian) were at least two million years older than the youngest fossils in Europe. The differences between ages suggests that ''Cretoxyrhina'' may have become [[local extinction|locally extinct]] in such areas over time until the genus as a whole went extinct.<ref name=SiversonandLindgren />

It has been noted that the decline of ''Cretoxyrhina'' coincides with the rise of newer predators such as ''Tylosaurus'', suggesting that increasing pressure from competition with the mosasaur and other predators of similar trophic levels may have played a major contribution to ''Cretoxyrhina'' 's decline and eventual extinction. Another possible factor was the gradual shallowing and shrinking of the Western Interior Seaway, which would have led to the disappearance of the pelagic environments preferred by the shark; this factor does not explain the decline and extinction of ''Cretoxyrhina'' elsewhere.<ref name=BourdonAndEverhart /> It has been suggested that the extinction of ''Cretoxyrhina'' may have helped the further increase the diversity of mosasaurs.<ref name=EverhartEvo />
