'''Quantum computing''' is a type of [[computation]] that harnesses the collective properties of [[quantum physics|quantum]] states, such as [[quantum superposition|superposition]], interference, and [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], to perform calculations. The devices that perform quantum computations are known as '''quantum computers'''.<ref name=2018Report>{{cite book | title=Quantum Computing : Progress and Prospects (2018) | page= I-5 | publisher=National Academies Press | editor-last1 = Grumbling | editor-first1 = Emily | editor-last2 = Horowitz | editor-first2 = Mark | author= The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|location=Washington, DC | year=2019 | doi=10.17226/25196|isbn=978-0-309-47969-1 | s2cid= 125635007 | oclc=1081001288 }}</ref>{{rp|I-5}} Though current quantum computers are too small to outperform usual (classical) computers for practical applications, they are believed to be capable of solving certain [[computational problem]]s, such as [[integer factorization]] (which underlies [[RSA encryption]]), substantially faster than classical computers.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|date=2021-06-08|title=What Makes Quantum Computing So Hard to Explain?|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-quantum-computing-so-hard-to-explain-20210608/|access-date=2021-11-09|website=Quanta Magazine|language=en}}</ref> The study of quantum computing is a subfield of [[quantum information science]].

<!-- Basic principles of quantum computing -->
There are several types of quantum computers (also known as quantum computing systems), including the [[quantum circuit|quantum circuit model]], [[quantum Turing machine]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|adiabatic quantum computer]], [[one-way quantum computer]], and various [[quantum cellular automata]]. The most widely used model is the [[quantum circuit]], based on the quantum bit, or "[[qubit]]", which is somewhat analogous to the [[bit]] in classical computation. A qubit can be in a 1 or 0 [[quantum state]], or in a superposition of the 1 and 0 states. When it is measured, however, it is always 0 or 1; the [[probability]] of either outcome depends on the qubit's quantum state immediately prior to measurement.

<!--Physical implementations-->
Efforts towards building a physical quantum computer focus on technologies such as [[transmon]]s, [[Trapped ion quantum computer|ion traps]] and [[topological quantum computer]]s, which aim to create high-quality qubits.<ref name="2018Report" />{{rp|2–13}} These qubits may be designed differently, depending on the full quantum computer's computing model, as to whether [[quantum logic gate]]s, [[quantum annealing]], or [[adiabatic quantum computation]] are employed. There are currently a number of significant obstacles to constructing useful quantum computers. It is particularly difficult to maintain qubits' quantum states, as they suffer from [[quantum decoherence]] and [[Fidelity of quantum states|state fidelity]]. Quantum computers therefore require [[Quantum error correction|error correction]].<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/1-4020-8068-9_8 |chapter=Challenges in Reliable Quantum Computing |title=Nano, Quantum and Molecular Computing |year=2004 |last1=Franklin |first1=Diana |last2=Chong |first2=Frederic T. |pages=247–266 |isbn=1-4020-8067-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Pakkin |first1=Scott |last2=Coles |first2=Patrick |title=The Problem with Quantum Computers |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-problem-with-quantum-computers/ |work=Scientific American |date=10 June 2019}}</ref>

As of 2022, quantum computing is a high-profile [[research and development]] activity in academic institutions and the private sector around the world.  A [[McKinsey & Company]] analysis states that "..investment dollars are pouring in, and quantum-computing start-ups are proliferating".  They go on to note that "While quantum computing promises to help businesses solve problems that are beyond the reach and speed of conventional high-performance computers, use cases are largely experimental and hypothetical at this early stage."<ref>{{cite web |title=Quantum computing use cases are getting real—what you need to know |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/quantum-computing-use-cases-are-getting-real-what-you-need-to-know |website=McKinsey & Company |publisher=McKinsey & Company |access-date=1 April 2022 |date=14 December 2021}}</ref>.   

<!-- Computability and complexity -->
Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer.<ref name="Nielsen, p. 29">Nielsen, p. 29</ref> Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough time. In other words, quantum computers obey the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. This means that while quantum computers provide no additional advantages over classical computers in terms of [[computability]], [[quantum algorithm]]s for certain problems have significantly lower [[time complexity|time complexities]] than corresponding known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer could solve in any ''feasible'' amount of time—a feat known as "quantum supremacy." The study of the [[computational complexity]] of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as [[quantum complexity theory]].

The prevailing model of quantum computation describes the computation in terms of a network of [[quantum logic gate]]s.<ref name="Nielsen-Chuang">{{Cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information: 10th Anniversary Edition|last1=Nielsen|first1=Michael A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511976667|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511976667|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/465953}}</ref> This model is a [[Complex number|complex]] [[linear algebra|linear-algebraic]] generalization of [[boolean circuit]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Quantum computing for computer scientists|last1=Yanofsky|first1=Noson S.|last2=Mannucci|first2=Mirco|date=2013|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-87996-5|pages=144–147,158–169}}</ref>

A memory consisting of <math display="inline">n</math> bits of information has <math display="inline">2^n</math> possible states. A vector representing all memory states thus has <math display="inline">2^n</math> entries (one for each state). This vector is viewed as a ''[[probability vector]]'' and represents the fact that the memory is to be found in a particular state.

In the classical view, one entry would have a value of 1 (i.e. a 100% probability of being in this state) and all other entries would be zero.

In quantum mechanics, probability vectors can be generalized to [[Density matrix|density operators]]. The [[quantum state]] vector formalism is usually introduced first because it is conceptually simpler, and because it can be used instead of the density matrix formalism ''for pure states,'' where the whole quantum system is known.

We begin by considering a simple memory consisting of only one bit. This memory may be found in one of two states: the zero state or the one state. We may represent the state of this memory using [[Bra–ket notation|Dirac notation]] so that
<math display="block">
 |0\rangle := \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix};\quad
 |1\rangle := \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
</math>
A quantum memory may then be found in any quantum superposition <math display="inline">|\psi\rangle</math> of the two classical states <math display="inline">|0\rangle</math> and <math display="inline">|1\rangle</math>:
<math display="block">
 |\psi\rangle := \alpha\,|0\rangle + \beta\,|1\rangle
               = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix};\quad
 |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1.
</math>
The coefficients <math display="inline">\alpha</math> and <math display="inline">\beta</math> are [[complex number]]s. One [[qubit]] of information is said to be encoded into the quantum memory. The state <math display="inline">|\psi\rangle</math> is not itself a probability vector but can be connected with a probability vector via a [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement operation]]. If the quantum memory is measured to determine whether the state is <math display="inline">|0\rangle</math> or <math display="inline">|1\rangle</math> (this is known as a computational basis measurement), the zero state would be observed with probability <math display="inline">|\alpha|^2</math> and the one state with probability <math display="inline">|\beta|^2</math>. The numbers <math display="inline">\alpha</math> and <math display="inline">\beta</math> are called [[probability amplitude]]s.

The state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying [[quantum logic gate]]s, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [[Logic gate|classical logic gates]]. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]
<math display="block">X := \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.</math>
Mathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with [[matrix multiplication]]. Thus <math display="inline">X|0\rangle = |1\rangle</math> and <math display="inline">X|1\rangle = |0\rangle</math>.

The mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multi-qubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit whilst leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are
<math display="block">
 |00\rangle := \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix};\quad
 |01\rangle := \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix};\quad
 |10\rangle := \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix};\quad
 |11\rangle := \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
</math>
The CNOT gate can then be represented using the following matrix:
<math display="block">
 \operatorname{CNOT} :=
 \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0
 \end{pmatrix}.
</math>
As a mathematical consequence of this definition, <math display="inline">\operatorname{CNOT}|00\rangle = |00\rangle</math>, <math display="inline">\operatorname{CNOT}|01\rangle = |01\rangle</math>, <math display="inline">\operatorname{CNOT}|10\rangle = |11\rangle</math>, and <math display="inline">\operatorname{CNOT}|11\rangle = |10\rangle</math>. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (<math display="inline">X</math> from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state <math display="inline">|1\rangle</math>. If the first qubit is <math display="inline">|0\rangle</math>, nothing is done to either qubit.

In summary, a quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.

Any quantum computation (which is, in the above formalism, any [[unitary matrix]] over <math>n</math> qubits) can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [[Quantum logic gate#Universal quantum gates|universal gate set]], since a computer that can run such circuits is a [[universal quantum computer]]. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the [[Solovay–Kitaev theorem|Solovay-Kitaev theorem]].

=== Quantum algorithms ===
{{Main|Quantum algorithm}}
<!-- Overview of quantum algorithms, particularly abstract routines with no explicit application -->
Progress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] exist. Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.<ref name="zoo">[http://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/ Quantum Algorithm Zoo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429014516/https://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/ |date=29 April 2018 }} – Stephen Jordan's Homepage</ref>

Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm include [[Shor's algorithm]] for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing [[discrete logarithm]]s, solving [[Pell's equation]], and more generally solving the [[hidden subgroup problem]] for abelian finite groups.<ref name="zoo"/> These algorithms depend on the primitive of the [[quantum Fourier transform]]. No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely.<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Jon |last1=Schiller |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l217ma2sWkoC&pg=PA11|title=Quantum Computers|isbn=9781439243497|date=19 June 2009}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=May 2020}} Certain oracle problems like [[Simon's problem]] and the [[Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm|Bernstein–Vazirani problem]] do give provable speedups, though this is in the [[quantum complexity theory#Quantum query complexity|quantum query model]], which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and doesn't necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems.

Other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain [[Jones polynomial]]s, and the [[quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations]] have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are [[BQP]]-complete. Because these problems are BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply that ''no quantum algorithm'' gives a super-polynomial speedup, which is believed to be unlikely.<ref name="Nielsen, p. 42">Nielsen, p. 42</ref>

Some quantum algorithms, like [[Grover's algorithm]] and [[amplitude amplification]], give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms.<ref name="zoo"/> Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems.<ref>Nielsen, p. 7</ref> Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are related to Grover's algorithm, including [[BHT algorithm|Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm]] for finding collisions in two-to-one functions,<ref>{{Citation|last1=Brassard|first1=Gilles|title=Quantum Algorithm for the Collision Problem|year=2016|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-2864-4_304|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Algorithms|pages=1662–1664|editor-last=Kao|editor-first=Ming-Yang|place=New York, NY|publisher=Springer|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-2864-4_304|isbn=978-1-4939-2864-4|access-date=6 December 2020|last2=Høyer|first2=Peter|last3=Tapp|first3=Alain|arxiv=quant-ph/9705002}}</ref> which uses Grover's algorithm, and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Farhi|first1=Edward|last2=Goldstone|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Gutmann|first3=Sam|date=23 December 2008|title=A Quantum Algorithm for the Hamiltonian NAND Tree|url=http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v004a008|journal=Theory of Computing|language=EN|volume=4|issue=1|pages=169–190|doi=10.4086/toc.2008.v004a008|s2cid=8258191|issn=1557-2862|doi-access=free}}</ref> which is a variant of the search problem.

== Potential applications ==
=== Cryptography ===
{{Main|Quantum cryptography|Post-quantum cryptography}}
A notable application of quantum computation is for [[cryptanalysis|attacks]] on cryptographic systems that are currently in use. [[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101–128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |s2cid=9816153 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archive-date=10 April 2015 }}</ref> By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie–Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.

=== Search problems{{anchor|Quantum_search}} ===

The most well-known example of a problem admitting a polynomial quantum speedup is ''unstructured search'', finding a marked item out of a list of <math>n</math> items in a database. This can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using <math>O(\sqrt{n})</math> queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the <math>\Omega(n)</math> queries required for classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups.

Problems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover's algorithm have the following properties:<ref>{{cite book|author=Colin P. Williams |year=2011 |title=Explorations in Quantum Computing |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-1-84628-887-6|pages=242–244}}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Grover| first=Lov| author-link=Lov Grover |title=A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search |date=29 May 1996| eprint=quant-ph/9605043}}</ref>
#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,
#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and
#There exists a boolean function that evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer

For problems with all these properties, the running time of Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which Grover's algorithm can be applied<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ambainis |first1=Ambainis |title=Quantum search algorithms |journal=ACM SIGACT News |date=June 2004 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=22–35 |doi=10.1145/992287.992296 |arxiv=quant-ph/0504012 |bibcode=2005quant.ph..4012A |s2cid=11326499 }}</ref> is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], where the ''database'' through which the algorithm iterates is that of all possible answers.

=== Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimization ===
[[Quantum annealing]] or [[Adiabatic quantum computation]] relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations. A system is placed in the ground state for a simple Hamiltonian, which is slowly evolved to a more complicated Hamiltonian whose ground state represents the solution to the problem in question. The adiabatic theorem states that if the evolution is slow enough the system will stay in its ground state at all times through the process.

There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dyakonov |first=Mikhail |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/the-case-against-quantum-computing |title=The Case Against Quantum Computing |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date=15 November 2018}}</ref> Physicist [[David P.

* Physically scalable to increase the number of qubits
* Qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values
* Quantum gates that are faster than [[decoherence]] time
* Universal gate set
* Qubits that can be read easily

Sourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult. Many quantum computers, like those constructed by [[Google]] and [[IBM]], need [[helium-3]], a [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] research byproduct, and special [[superconducting]] cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Giles |first1=Martin |title=We'd have more quantum computers if it weren't so hard to find the damn cables |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612760/quantum-computers-component-shortage/ |publisher=MIT Technology Review |date=17 January 2019}}</ref>

The control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the development of [[quantum controllers]] which enable interfacing with the qubits. Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=S. J. Pauka, K. Das, R. Kalra, A. Moini, Y. Yang, M. Trainer, A. Bousquet, C.

==== Quantum decoherence ====
{{Main|Quantum decoherence}}

One of the greatest challenges involved with constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing [[quantum decoherence]]. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''<sub>2</sub> (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name="DiVincenzo 1995">{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255–261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 |s2cid=220110562 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a [[dilution refrigerator]]<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cryogenics.2021.103390| issn=0011-2275 | title = Development of Dilution refrigerators – A review | journal = Cryogenics| volume = 121| year = 2022| last1 = Zu | first1 = H.| last2 = Dai | first2 = W.| last3 = de Waele | first3 = A.T.A.M.| bibcode = 2022Cryo..121....1Z| s2cid = 244005391 }}</ref>) in order to prevent significant decoherence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286–288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J|doi-access=free}}</ref> A 2020 study argues that [[ionizing radiation]] such as [[cosmic rays]] can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vepsäläinen |first1=Antti P. |last2=Karamlou |first2=Amir H. |last3=Orrell |first3=John L. |last4=Dogra |first4=Akshunna S. |last5=Loer |first5=Ben |last6=Vasconcelos |first6=Francisca |last7=Kim |first7=David K. |last8=Melville |first8=Alexander J. |last9=Niedzielski |first9=Bethany M. |last10=Yoder |first10=Jonilyn L. |last11=Gustavsson |first11=Simon |last12=Formaggio |first12=Joseph A. |last13=VanDevender |first13=Brent A. |last14=Oliver |first14=William D. |display-authors=5 |title=Impact of ionizing radiation on superconducting qubit coherence |journal=Nature |date=August 2020 |volume=584 |issue=7822 |pages=551–556 |doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2619-8 |pmid=32848227 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2619-8 |language=en |issn=1476-4687|arxiv=2001.09190 |bibcode=2020Natur.584..551V |s2cid=210920566 }}</ref>

As a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.<ref>{{cite arXiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=30 November 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}</ref>

These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.

As described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use [[quantum error correction]] to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10<sup>−3</sup>, assuming the noise is depolarizing.

Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> bits without error correction.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M. I. |date=14 October 2006 |pages=4–18 |journal=Future Trends in Microelectronics. Up the Nano Creek |editor1=S. Luryi |editor2=J. Xu |editor3=A. Zaslavsky | arxiv=quant-ph/0610117|bibcode=2006quant.ph.10117D }}</ref> With error correction, the figure would rise to about 10<sup>7</sup> bits. Computation time is about ''L''<sup>2</sup> or about 10<sup>7</sup> steps and at 1&nbsp;MHz, about 10 seconds.

A very different approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a [[topological quantum computer]] with [[anyon]]s, [[quasi-particle]]s used as threads and relying on [[braid theory]] to form stable logic gates.<ref>{{cite journal

=== Skepticism ===

Some researchers have expressed skepticism that scalable quantum computers could ever be built, typically because of the issue of maintaining coherence at large scales.

[[Bill Unruh]] doubted the practicality of quantum computers in a paper published back in 1994.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Unruh|first1=Bill|title=Maintaining coherence in Quantum Computers|journal=Physical Review A|volume=51|issue=2|pages=992–997|arxiv=hep-th/9406058|bibcode=1995PhRvA..51..992U|year=1995|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.51.992|pmid=9911677|s2cid=13980886}}</ref> [[Paul Davies]] argued that a 400-qubit computer would even come into conflict with the cosmological information bound implied by the [[holographic principle]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=The implications of a holographic universe for quantum information science and the nature of physical law|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/quant-ph/papers/0703/0703041.pdf|publisher=Macquarie University}}</ref> Skeptics like [[Gil Kalai]] doubt that quantum supremacy will ever be achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/04/22/quantum-supremacy-and-complexity/|title=Quantum Supremacy and Complexity|date=23 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Kalai|first1=Gil|title=The Quantum Computer Puzzle|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201605/rnoti-p508.pdf|publisher=AMS}}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv|last1=Rinott|first1=Yosef|last2=Shoham|first2=Tomer|last3=Kalai|first3=Gil|date=2021-07-13|title=Statistical Aspects of the Quantum Supremacy Demonstration|class=quant-ph|eprint=2008.05177}}</ref> Physicist [[Mikhail Dyakonov]] has expressed skepticism of quantum computing as follows:

=== Models of computation for quantum computing ===
There are a number of [[model of computation|models of computation]] for quantum computing, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed. For practical implementations, the four relevant models of computation are:
* [[quantum circuit|Quantum gate array]] – Computation decomposed into a sequence of few-qubit [[quantum gate]]s.
* [[One-way quantum computer]] – Computation decomposed into a sequence of [[Bell_state#Bell_state_measurement|Bell state measurements]] and single-qubit [[quantum gate]]s applied to a highly entangled initial state (a [[cluster state]]), using a technique called [[quantum gate teleportation]].
* [[Adiabatic quantum computation|Adiabatic quantum computer]], based on [[quantum annealing]] – Computation decomposed into a slow continuous transformation of an initial [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution.<ref name="Das 2008 1061–1081">{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=A.|last2=Chakrabarti|first2=B.

This equivalence need not hold for practical quantum computers, since the overhead of simulation may be too large to be practical.

==Relation to computability and complexity theory==
===Computability theory===
{{See also|Computability theory}}
Any [[computational problem]] solvable by a classical computer is also solvable by a quantum computer.<ref name="Nielsen, p. 29"/> Intuitively, this is because it is believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of classical computers, can be described using [[quantum mechanics]], which underlies the operation of quantum computers.

Conversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also solvable by a classical computer. It is possible to simulate both quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and a pen, if given enough time. More formally, any quantum computer can be simulated by a [[Turing machine]]. In other words, quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of [[computability]]. This means that quantum computers cannot solve [[undecidable problem]]s like the [[halting problem]] and the existence of quantum computers does not disprove the [[Church–Turing thesis]].<ref>Nielsen, p. 126</ref>

===Quantum complexity theory===
{{Main|Quantum complexity theory}}
<!-- Power and limits of quantum computers -->
While quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can solve certain problems faster than classical computers. For instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently [[integer factorization|factor integers]], while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.

<!-- Basic definition of BQP -->
The class of [[computational problem|problems]] that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer with bounded error is called [[BQP]], for "bounded error, quantum, polynomial time". More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time [[quantum Turing machine]] with an error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] ("bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time"), the class of problems that can be solved by polynomial-time [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s with bounded error.<ref>Nielsen, p. 41</ref> It is known that <math>\mathsf{BPP\subseteq BQP}</math> and is widely suspected that <math>\mathsf{BQP\subsetneq BPP}</math>, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of [[time complexity]].<ref>Nielsen, p. 201</ref>

<!-- Relation of BQP to basic complexity classes -->
[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes.<ref name="Nielsen, p. 42"/>]]
The exact relationship of BQP to [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], and [[PSPACE (complexity)|PSPACE]] is not known. However, it is known that <math>\mathsf{P\subseteq BQP \subseteq PSPACE}</math>; that is, all problems that can be efficiently solved by a deterministic classical computer can also be efficiently solved by a quantum computer, and all problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a deterministic classical computer with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, [[integer factorization]] and the [[discrete logarithm problem]] are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems that are believed not to be in P are also in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that <math>\mathsf{NP\nsubseteq BQP}</math>; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [[NP-complete]] problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it would follow from [[NP-hard]]ness that all problems in NP are in BQP).<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411–1473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref>

<!-- Summary of relationship to essential complexity classes -->
The relationship of BQP to the basic classical complexity classes can be summarized as follows:
:<math>\mathsf{P \subseteq BPP \subseteq BQP \subseteq PP \subseteq PSPACE}</math>
It is also known that BQP is contained in the complexity class [[Sharp-P|{{tmath|\color{Blue}\mathsf{\#P} }}]] (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems {{tmath|\mathsf{P^{\#P} } }}),<ref name=BernVazi/> which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].

<!-- Speculation about more advanced types of quantum computers -->
It has been speculated that further advances in physics could lead to even faster computers. For instance, it has been shown that a non-local hidden variable quantum computer based on [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Bohmian Mechanics]] could implement a search of an {{mvar|N}}-item database in at most <math>O(\sqrt[3]{N})</math> steps, a slight speedup over [[Grover's algorithm]], which runs in <math>O(\sqrt{N})</math> steps. Note, however, that neither search method would allow quantum computers to solve [[NP-complete]] problems in polynomial time.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/qchvpra.pdf|title=Quantum Computing and Hidden Variables|last=Aaronson|first=Scott}}</ref> Theories of [[quantum gravity]], such as [[M-theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]], may allow even faster computers to be built. However, defining computation in these theories is an open problem due to the [[problem of time]]; that is, within these physical theories there is currently no obvious way to describe what it means for an observer to submit input to a computer at one point in time and then receive output at a later point in time.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Scott|last=Aaronson|title=NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality|journal=ACM SIGACT News|volume=2005|arxiv=quant-ph/0502072|year=2005|bibcode=2005quant.ph..2072A|author-link=Scott Aaronson}} See section 7 "Quantum Gravity": "[…] to anyone who wants a test or benchmark for a favorite quantum gravity theory,[author's footnote: That is, one without all the bother of making numerical predictions and comparing them to observation] let me humbly propose the following: ''can you define Quantum Gravity Polynomial-Time?'' […] until we can say what it means for a 'user' to specify an 'input' and ‘later' receive an 'output'—''there is no such thing as computation, not even theoretically.''"
