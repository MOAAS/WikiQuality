| ShortSummary    = The series opens with Julie Mao in a spacesuit alone aboard a spaceship. On the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], Detective Miller is assigned to find Mao and return her to her rich parents on [[Moon|Luna]]. In New York, UN executive Chrisjen Avasarala interrogates a captured operative of the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA), a militant Belter group, about contraband stealth technology. On its way to Ceres, the ice hauler ''Canterbury'' receives a distress signal from the freighter ''Scopuli'', and acting Executive Officer Jim Holden is ordered to lead a rescue mission with the ship's engineer Naomi Nagata, the mechanic Amos Burton, the pilot Alex Kamal, and the medic Shed Garvey. They find the ship empty but for a distress transmitter, but as their shuttle heads back to the ''Canterbury'', a stealth ship destroys the ice carrier with nuclear torpedoes.

| ShortSummary    = On Ceres, Miller investigates the theft of water, now severely rationed due to the ''Canterbury''{{'}}s failure to arrive. In Julie Mao's apartment, he finds clues placing her aboard the ''Scopuli''. On Earth, Avasarala sends the suspected OPA captive to Luna after her superior, Undersecretary Sadavir Errinwright, disapproves of "gravity torture", but the captive commits suicide. In the asteroid belt, the ''Canterbury''{{'}}s shuttle is damaged by debris from the ice hauler's destruction. Using the last of their air, the survivors build an improvised antenna to place a distress call, which is responded to by the Martian Congressional Republic Navy (MCRN) flagship ''Donnager''. After Nagata identifies the distress transponder aboard the ''Scopuli'' as using Martian military technology, Holden broadcasts a message to that effect to the Solar System, as insurance against being killed as inconvenient witnesses.

| ShortSummary    = Holden's broadcast triggers protests on Ceres, with the OPA blaming Mars for the destruction of the ''Canterbury''. In the course of violent riots, Miller's partner Havelock is attacked, almost fatally, and a man with the handle "Nightbandit31", with whom Mao was in contact, is killed. On Earth, Avasarala tests her theory that Mars was behind the attack by leaking to Mars information about the transfer of Martian stealth technology to the OPA. She deduces from the panicked Martian reaction that Mars was not responsible – but that somebody else wants to start a war. Aboard the Martian warship ''Donnager'', the ''Canterbury''{{'}}s survivors are detained and questioned, with Nagata in particular being suspected of being part of an OPA sleeper cell. Complicating matters further, an unidentified ship flies towards the ''Donnager'', ignoring all requests to divert or identify itself.

| ShortSummary    = On Ceres, Miller identifies the dead "Nightbandit31" as Bizi Betiko, only to later discover the real Betiko is still alive. Miller then learns that the deceased was a data broker with multiple spoofed electronic ID's and an implanted, encrypted memory storage device. In the asteroid belt, the ''Donnager''{{'}}s pursuers reveal themselves as six ships of the type that had attacked the ''Canterbury'', and they open fire on the ''Donnager''. Unexpectedly at a technological disadvantage, the Martian ship takes heavy damage, and Shed Garvey is decapitated by a [[railgun]] shot. As the ''Donnager'' is being boarded, the surviving ''Canterbury'' crew is evacuated on the Martian captain's orders,  hoping to spare Holden as a witness to the attackers. The crew narrowly escapes aboard a [[frigate]] from ''Donnager''{{'}}s bay, right before the ''Donnager'' self-destructs to avoid capture. Far from the battle, at Tycho Station, a massive [[generation ship]], the ''Nauvoo'', is being built at the behest of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Station manager Fred Johnson, who's tied to the OPA, turns the ''Nauvoo''{{'}}s sensors towards the battle.

| ShortSummary    = For lack of options, the ''Canterbury''{{'}}s survivors accept a proposal by Fred Johnson to join him at Tycho Station, and with his help they modify the ship's transponder, renaming their salvaged ship the ''[[Rocinante]]'', to hide the fact that it's a Martian warship. A flashback shows how Johnson became "the Butcher of Anderson Station" eleven years ago: as a UN Marine colonel, he led an assault on a station occupied by protesting miners, killing all despite their attempts at surrender. On Ceres, Miller finds evidence linking Julie Mao to the OPA, which tries to recruit him through its local agent Anderson Dawes. While leaving Julie's apartment with the data chip, Miller is abducted by unknown people.

| ShortSummary    = On Ceres, Miller is interrogated and tortured by Dawes, demanding to know what he has learned about Julie. Miller escapes with fellow officer Octavia Muss and discovers revealing information on a hidden data cube, a major secret. Upon revealing his discovery to his boss, she fires Miller and takes all information regarding the case. Avasarala wants a spy on Tycho Station and resorts to extortion to get her way. Holden and crew arrive at Tycho Station, with Fred Johnson planning to leverage Holden's testimony for legitimacy with the UN. Holden makes an uneasy alliance, sharing everything he knows about the destruction of the ''Canterbury'' and the MCRN ''Donnager''. Johnson seems fairly convinced neither Earth nor Mars was behind the attacks. After disguising the ''Rocinante'' as a simple gas hauler, they set out for Eros to pick up a potential survivor of the ''Scopuli''.

| ShortSummary    = During a visit to Holden's co-op parents' house in [[Montana]], Avasarala learns of Holden's troubled childhood and gains some insight into his recent decisions. On their way to [[433 Eros|Eros]], the crew of the ''Rocinante'' realize too late that Kenzo, a spy from Tycho station, is on board and has inadvertently gotten the attention of a Martian patrol. Kenzo helps obtain the MCRN codebook from the ship's safe, and with a few code words the patrol backs off, believing the ''Rocinante'' to be a Martian black ops ship. Miller departs Ceres for Eros, with a new piece to the mysterious puzzle surrounding Julie Mao.

| ShortSummary    = The ''Rocinante'' arrives at their true destination, an asteroid at coordinates given by Fred Johnson, and discovers the ''Anubis'', the stealth ship that had destroyed the ''Canterbury''. It is empty except for a mysterious, spreading, organic substance that covers the ship's reactor. They scuttle the stealth ship, then head to Eros to find a survivor of the ''Scopuli'' code-named Lionel Polanski, who escaped the ''Anubis'' on its shuttle. Miller is also tracking down Polanski, identifying her as Julie Mao. Arriving at Eros, Holden and his team are ambushed at the hotel where Polanski is staying by a UN black ops team (signaled by Kenzo and authorized by Errinwright), but are saved by Miller. After joining up, Holden's team and Miller go to meet Julie Mao only to find her already dead, infected by the substance from the ''Anubis''.

| ShortSummary    = The events leading up to Julie Mao's infection by the unknown biohazard on the ''Anubis'' and her gruesome death in her hotel room on Eros are revealed in a flashback. Fred Johnson broadcasts evidence that the stealth ships were built on Earth. After Miller and the ''Rocinante'' crew flee the hotel, Julie's body is found and studied by Dresden (a scientist working for Julie's father, Jules-Pierre Mao), who harvests her infected blood. Under the guise of a ship explosion and radiation leak, mercenaries loyal to Julie's father and Dresden place Eros into lockdown and seal the poverty-stricken citizens into radiation shelters after infecting them with Julie's blood. Most of the ''Rocinante'' crew head back to the ship, while Miller and Holden go to investigate the shelters. Discovering their true purpose as incubators for the infection, with everyone inside dead or dying, they also receive a lethal dose of radiation.

| ShortSummary    = Miller, Holden, and the ''Rocinante'' crew, suffering from radiation sickness, make their separate ways through the increasingly horrific situation on Eros towards the ship. They theorize that the conspirators behind the stealth ships are using the population as food for the "protomolecule" infection. Miller begins to see hallucinations of Julie Mao. Amos kills Miller's friend, Inspector Sematimba, after he holds Nagata at gunpoint when she refuses to launch the ''Rocinante'' without Holden. Miller and Holden make it to the ship, which escapes, and are treated for radiation sickness. On Earth, Avasarala's investigation is stopped by Errinwright, who is part of the Mao conspiracy. On Eros, the UN spy Kenzo is left to be consumed by the rapidly advancing protomolecule infesting the colony.

The United Nations debates blockading MCRN fleet deployments; Avasarala backs the measure but privately believes that she is being prepared by Errinwright as a scapegoat, and hires private security. An MCRN vessel fires on a UNN vessel; the UN elects not to fire back, figuring that the Martian missiles were saber-rattling. The missiles pass the UNN vessel and destroy Phoebe Station. Draper believes that war with Earth is good; her commanding officer, Sutton, believes war must be avoided. Holden and Miller recover from radiation sickness; Miller and Amos have a violent disagreement that is broken up by Naomi. The ''Rocinante'' crew finds a protomolecule sample in a cryogenic safe recovered from the ''Anubis'' and decide to hide it in a debris field. Naomi and Holden perform repairs to the ''Rocinante'' and their personal relationship deepens. Alex cooks lasagna for the crew of the ''Rocinante'', and over dinner tensions are eased.

| ShortSummary    = Avasarala hires freelance spy Cotyar Ghazi. The ''Rocinante'' arrives at Tycho Station and Johnson is unhappy with them, but the situation is defused by explaining what is happening on Eros and that the data from the Eros incident is being beamed to Thoth Station. Fred Johnson pulls together a strike team from rival Outer Planets Alliance factions, killing one of their leaders in the process. The ''Rocinante'' is assigned as the mission's muscle in the assault on Thoth Station, engaging the station's defenses and clearing a path for the boarding party. The station is not prepared to defend itself, and falls easily to the team. They capture the lead scientist on the project, Dresden, and an underling, Cortazar. Dresden is uninterested in who he answers to as long as he can continue his work. Dresden explains the source, dangers, and possibilities of the protomolecule and tries to convince Holden and Johnson to let him continue the project, but Miller shoots him in the head.

| ShortSummary    = Earth destroys Mars's moon [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] as retaliation for the MCRN's nuking of Phoebe. This creates tension in Bobbie Draper's squad. Holden and his crew return to Tycho Station, angry at Miller for killing Dresden, the lead scientist on the protomolecule project. Fred Johnson tells Miller that he needs to leave, but Miller remains and visits the Mormon temple. Johnson and Holden figure out how to get the captured scientist Cortazar to talk. Miller realizes that Eros must be destroyed, and that Fred Johnson has the equipment necessary to do so: the ''Nauvoo''.

| ShortSummary    = Avasarala gathers information linking the protomolecule to Jules-Pierre Mao, Julie's father, and hatches a plan to leak this information. Miller's ''Nauvoo'' plan is put into action. After assembling a demolition team to seal Eros's docks, the ''Nauvoo'' is evacuated of its people, commandeered, and set on a [[collision course]] to knock Eros into the Sun. After flying to Eros, the ''Rocinante'' drops its cargo of bombs and the demolition team retrieves them for precise placement. A complication arises when a group of humanitarian doctors is found who will not follow Holden's orders, so he destroys their ship to prevent spreading the protomolecule infection. The debris damages one of Miller's bombs, and he chooses to stay with it on Eros, watching the ''Nauvoo'' approach, but no collision takes place. Holden and crew confirm that the ''Nauvoo'' did not miss – despite having no human-built propulsion system capable of doing so, Eros maneuvered to avoid the impact.

| ShortSummary    = Eros is speeding on collision course for Earth. Miller and the crew decide that Miller will bring the bomb into the heart of Eros to destroy it and then escape back to the ''Rocinante''. On Earth, the United Nations decides to fire its planetary defense nuclear missiles at the incoming Eros, but the asteroid evades them by 'going stealth', ceasing to reflect radar. The ''Rocinante'' crew use their proximity to the asteroid to provide a target lock to Fred Johnson, who will guide the missiles to Eros. Eros reacts to this by accelerating still faster; to maintain visual contact, the ''Rocinante'' accelerates at the limits of human endurance and finally gives up the chase. Miller arrives with the bomb at the heart of Eros and discovers a transformed Julie Mao. While the protomolecule has infected her and Eros, she has in some way infected it back, and can influence Eros's trajectory. With a combination of words and affection, and after removing his protective spacesuit, Miller convinces her to redirect Eros away from Earth toward Venus, where it crashes in a planetary-scale event.

| ShortSummary    = Flashbacks show Martian colonist Solomon Epstein envisaging a future where Mars is freed from Earth's control by use of his fusion drive. In the present, Avasarala demands Errinwright bring Mao out of hiding by threatening Mao's family and business empire. On Tycho, Fred Johnson's idea to use the thirty missing nukes as a bargaining chip against Earth and Mars angers Holden. The ''Rocinante'' crew commiserate over Miller's death and agree to launch the protomolecule sample into the sun. Naomi fakes the launch; the others believe there is no sample left. On Ganymede, Bobbie Draper and her marines are sent to patrol the agricultural farms. They see UN marines running towards them, firing. Their comms are jammed. The UNN and MCRN fleets in orbit each think the jamming is part of an attack by the others. A full scale battle breaks out in orbit. This destroys several of the giant orbital mirrors. The crashing wreckage devastates the colony.  The ''Scirocco'' comes under fire and Sutton is killed. After the battle, an injured Bobbie awakes to find her team massacred and an inhuman figure standing over her.

| ShortSummary    = After the Ganymede battle, Bobbie is rescued by the MCRN and asked to report the events, which some of her superiors do not believe. On Earth, Avasarala demands a peace summit between Earth and Mars to prevent further escalation of the tension, in which both planets believed the other fired first on Ganymede. Over three thousand people were killed in the Ganymede Incident, and the massive damage to the colony destroyed the agricultural domes that the Belt depends on – leading to a starvation and refugee crisis. On Tycho Station, a recently arrived Anderson Dawes is asked to represent the Belt in negotiations for peace with Earth and Mars, but Dawes convinces the Belters that Earth and Mars will never respect the Belt. Bobbie is ordered to Earth to the peace summit, and to tell Earth that Mars fired first accidentally, despite Bobbie remembering the presence of an alien figure the UN marines were fleeing from. On Tycho, Dawes becomes aware of Cortazar's presence and knowledge. Cortazar is later found to be missing from his cell, leading Alex and Naomi to chase after an escaping ship, only to find Diogo aboard and Dawes and Cortazar gone.

| ShortSummary    = Aboard a Ganymede refugee ship, the botanist Praxideke Meng (Prax) and others are headed for safety as he privately mourns the loss of his daughter Mei, presumed dead when the mirrors fell from orbit. The ship's crew throws refugees from the inner planets, including Prax's friend, out of the airlock, reflecting the rising tension between the Belters and the Inners. The ship later arrives at Tycho Station, which is inundated with thousands of refugees from Ganymede. On Tycho, the ''Rocinante'' crew discovers that a protomolecule 'shout' (signal) came from Ganymede at the time of the battle and that a pediatrician, Dr. Strickland, who used to work for Protogen, was also on Ganymede. They connect to Prax after they discover the footage showing Strickland leaving the pediatric clinic with Prax's daughter one hour before the battle. Meanwhile, Dawes's supporters on Tycho storm the bridge and take Fred Johnson and his subordinate Camina Drummer hostage, wanting to launch the missiles back to Earth in order to provoke a fight, but are unsuccessful when the ''Rocinante'' crew intervenes. Prax, with the ''Rocinante'' crew, set off for Ganymede with renewed hope his daughter is still alive.

| ShortSummary    = Approaching Jupiter, the crew of the ''Rocinante'' realize that their ship is too obvious, so they commandeer the ''Weeping Somnambulist'', unable to convince that crew they mean no harm. The Mars delegation arrives on Earth for peace negotiations, and Bobbie Draper gives testimony that makes it look like Mars started the battle of Ganymede by accident. Alex takes the ''Rocinante'' to hide behind a Jovian moon, awaiting a call from the crew for pickup or rescue, and Prax is unimpressed with the crew's planning abilities. Upon arrival, Holden and Amos realize something is wrong on the ''Somnambulist'' and, while attempting to intervene, one of the ''Somnambulist''{{'}}s crew is killed. A research vessel in orbit around Venus, the ''Arboghast'', discovers that the Eros impact zone is teeming with unexplained activity, information that Avasarala matches with Bobbie Draper's additional testimony to realize that the solar system is still in danger.

| ShortSummary    = Despite confinement by her commanding officer, Bobbie sneaks out of the Martian embassy to see the ocean. She passes through an enclave of [[street people]] under some overpasses along the way. Errinwright confesses to Avasarala his role in helping Jules-Pierre Mao with the Eros incident. Avasarala approaches Bobbie with images of the inhuman figure from Ganymede, now believing Mao created it as a weapon which could wind up in Mars' possession. On Ganymede, Amos beats an information dealer for footage of Dr. Strickland taking Mei to the oldest part of Ganymede station. Prax realizes too much damage has been done to Ganymede's ecosystem to ever repair it. Alone on the ''Rocinante,'' Alex receives the MCRN alert declaring Ganymede a no-fly zone.

| ShortSummary    = Bobbie forces Captain Martens to reveal Jules-Pierre Mao's protomolecule technology project. A demonstration of it caused the Ganymede Incident and triggered the battle in orbit. The technology is now for sale. Bobbie takes the information to Avasarala at the UN and requests political asylum. Mao offers to explain everything to Avasarala if she meets with him outside of UN control. She accepts over Cotyar's objections. The research team aboard the UNS ''Arboghast'' lands a probe on Venus. They see a massive protomolecule structure before the probe fails. Alex uses a [[Gravity slingshot]] to sneak the ''Rocinante'' past the MCRN blockade of Ganymede. Holden and crew explore the old part of the station. They find guards and scientists having a pizza party. After Prax starts a gun fight, the survivors barricade themselves in a back room. Holden and Prax realize the protomolecule monsters are actually Belter children with genetic peculiarities and deliberately infected with protomolecule. The fate of Mei is unclear. Most of the enemy is killed by a protomolecule monster, but a dying scientist says there are plenty more out there. The party splits. Naomi and Amos evacuate people off Ganymede, while Holden, Prax, and Alex hunt the protomolecule monster on the surface.

| ShortSummary    = Errinwright expresses remorse to Avasarala as she departs to Mao's ship with Bobbie and Cotyar. Mao claims he will give both Earth and Mars access to the protomolecule while he sits comfortably in the middle, preventing war. Errinwright meets with Martian Defense Minister Korshunov, poisoning him with a banned toxin for Martians that makes it look as if he died from a heart attack while also ordering the destruction of the Martian black-ops ship MCRN ''Karakum'' that was dispatched to collect the protomolecule monster on Ganymede. Errinwright subtly orders Mao to kill Avasarala and tie up loose ends. Holden becomes increasingly aggressive while hunting the protomolecule monster. Naomi and Amos repair the ''Somnambulist'' and though it can carry up to 300 people, there is only enough oxygen in the air tanks for 52 people, while over 100 refugees riot at the door. Naomi, with the help of a Belter who gives up his spot to her, manages to evacuate all the children and some young adults. When the ''Somnambulist'' is fired upon for violating the MCRN blockade, Alex convinces Holden to save them, threatening the MCRN ships with the ''Rocinante''{{'}}s arsenal. The protomolecule monster is shown to have stowed away aboard the ''Rocinante''.

| ShortSummary    = The protomolecule monster is found in the cargo bay on the ''Rocinante.'' It attacks Holden, crushing his leg and pinning him to the wall. It tears out panels to get to the reactor core for its radiation. Amos says the only way to get rid of it is to use the air on the ship as a pressurized blast to force it into space, which would also kill Holden. Prax sees the monster craves radiation and suggests the nuclear core in a ship's missile could lure it out. Naomi and Prax expose a core; Prax throws it into space. The monster jumps after it and is incinerated by the main engine. Cotyar is wounded in a shootout with Mao's men. Bobbie manages to sneak away to get her power armor and saves him and Avasarala. As the science team on the ''Arboghast'' begins a descent to the surface of Venus to examine the protomolecule structure, the ship is stopped and disassembled in an increasing spherical pattern. Naomi confesses to Holden that she never destroyed their protomolecule sample; with Earth and Mars already fighting over it, the Belt needed it too, so she gave it to Fred Johnson. On [[Io (moon)|Io]], Mei and other children are shown to be kept in stasis by Dr. Strickland.

| ShortSummary    = The crew cleans up the ''Rocinante'', missing a small piece of protomolecule in the process. They also conduct repairs and rename the ship ''Pinus Contorta'' to hide during escalating tension between Earth and Mars. Errinwright convinces the UN to declare war, Mars blames Earth for the assassination of defence minister Korshunov, and everyone wonders what is happening on Venus. Things are strained between Naomi and the crew. Though Naomi wants them to dock at Tycho, Holden picks up a protomolecule signal on Io, convincing the others to find answers for Prax. Fred Johnson reaches out to Dawes to use the scientist and protomolecule to work together, and orders the ''Nauvoo'' retrieved as the Belt must unite as one nation. Errinwright frames Avasarala for Eros and says she is the one working with Mao, having missiles fired at Mao's ship to kill her. Bobbie, Avasarala and Cotyar force one of the employees of the ship, Theo, to help them gather evidence to expose Errinwright, then Bobbie and Avasarala escape on Mao's racing ship ''Razorback'', while Theo and Cotyar escape on a landing shuttle.

| ShortSummary    = As the civilians of Earth get more afraid about war with Mars, Secretary General Esteban Sorrento-Gillis calls in old friend Methodist pastor and Doctor Annushka "Anna" Volovodov; to help convince the people that God is on Earth's side. Anna irritates Errinwright by calling for restraint. Jules-Pierre Mao visits Dr Strickland on Io, considering shutting down the whole project, though Strickland reveals the children of Ganymede can be controlled hosts for the protomolecule, including Mei. Pursuing the ''Razorback'', Errinwright's men fire again and Avasarala's body cannot take the force of acceleration needed to escape. Bobbie sends out a Martian distress signal that is picked up by Holden's crew. Holden and Amos want to ignore it and Alex and Naomi want to help. Prax breaks the tie and decides to assist them. Holden has torpedoes fired around the ''Razorback'' as a shield and then uses an explosion for cover to get in close to disable the UN ship's engines. After Amos saves his life, Prax admits he is scared of what he will find on Io, though Amos says Prax shouldn't give up on his daughter. As Avasarala passes out, she and Bobbie are picked up by a stunned Holden and crew.

| ShortSummary    = The ''Thomas Prince'' enters the Ring. Anna and others on board theorize the Ring is trying to isolate potential threats. Anna's friend Tilly recognizes Melba as Clarissa Mao and confronts her. Clarissa attacks Tilly to avoid being revealed. The Investigator admits he is just a construct in Holden's brain attempting to fulfill the protomolecule's mission of discovering what happened to an ancient civilization. As Holden goes towards the station at the center of the pocket dimension he touches a circuit, revealing Miller's last thoughts to get Holden to comply. Believing Holden to be insane, a Martian team including Bobbie follow him. They fire at Holden but the bullets are stopped in mid-air and a Martian lieutenant is disassembled and absorbed by the station when he throws a grenade. The station forces every ship to slow down further, interrupting Clarissa's attack on Tilly. Holden touches the circuit and is shown visions from the protomolecule's point of view. He is shown previous events in reverse before witnessing events in the distant past, planets exploding and a connection to farther away in space, and finally loses consciousness.

| ShortSummary    = The mass deceleration caused fatalities and severe wounds among all the ships; without gravity internal wounds cannot drain, meaning many more will die. Naomi returns to the ''Rocinante'' treating a wounded Amos and Alex. On the ''Behemoth'', Drummer and Ashford are pinned on opposite sides of a large piece of equipment, working together to try to free themselves and learning about each other. Drummer allows it to roll forward, crushing her further to give the ship a captain in Ashford. Once free, to treat Drummer and the others, Ashford commands the ship's drum to create spin gravity, opening the ship to everyone's wounded. Leaving Tilly for dead, Clarissa realizes with all ships being drawn to the center, she can board the ''Rocinante''. However, Tilly survives just long enough to tell Anna the truth. Clarissa boards the ship and attacks Naomi, seeking Holden, but Anna follows and tasers her from behind. On Bobbie's skiff, Holden wakes up and tells her he saw a vision detailing the end of everything.

| ShortSummary    = Everyone boards the ''Behemoth'' with all weapons seized by the OPA. Holden is believed to be insane and Clarissa wears an injection system to impair her abilities. She is locked across from Holden without him knowing who she is. Anna tells her all she can hope for now is forgiveness. Holden tells Ashford the beings that created the Rings and protomolecule were somehow killed and used Rings to destroy [[planetary system]]s, attempting to save themselves. Drummer builds herself mechanical legs with help from Naomi, whom she later reunites with Holden. Clarissa can hear Holden's torment as he tries to get Miller to tell him what to do next. Amos takes a liking to Anna. A tech from Earth has the idea to send a damaged skiff with a nuclear missile to try and weaken the field blocking immobilizing ships and blocking the laser communication to the outside world. In response, the station begins charging energy. Ashford realizes the station intends to destroy the entire solar system and convinces the leaders of Earth and Mars to destroy the Ring with the laser, saving humanity at the cost of marooning everyone inside the Ring.

A convoy of Belter refugee ships from Ganymede attempts to run the blockade; of the few that succeed, the ''Barbapiccola'' lands on a planet named "Ilus" which features prominent alien structures. Avasarala sends Holden there as her envoy, with the rest of his crew joining him, in order to identify any potential protomolecule exposure. Naomi begins taking brutal drugs in order to develop a tolerance to high gravity. On Mars, Bobbie dismantles decommissioned warships for a living, discontented with her plight. With a truce between Earth, Mars, and the Belt in effect, Ashford operates as an OPA peacekeeper, tracking down and neutralizing renegades; Drummer commands the former ''Behemoth'', now renamed ''Medina Station'', which controls the Ring Space. The Earth ship ''Edward Israel'', ferrying a Royal Charter Energy (RCE) expedition backed by Earth and Mars, sends a shuttle to Ilus that is destroyed during its landing; many lives and supplies are lost. The ''Rocinante'' crew arrives amid tensions between the surviving shuttle passengers and the Belter settlers that escalate into an armed standoff; it is interrupted when a swarm of alien "bugs" attacks the settlement.

| ShortSummary    = Avasarala visits Mars and invites Bobbie to a [[state banquet]]. At the banquet, Bobbie is rebuffed by fellow Martians and offended when she perceives that she is being used by Avasarala; she rejects a job offer from Avasarala. Bobbie discovers that her nephew, David, is preparing illicit "focus drugs" for a gang. She ends his involvement by beating up the gang members and destroying their lab. On Ilus, the ''Rocinante'' crew navigates the ongoing tensions between the Belters and Earthers; they identify the bugs as protomolecule-based. The drugs Naomi has been taking have not been fully successful. RCE Security Chief Adolphus Murtry, who took charge after the expedition's leader had died, identifies the shuttle's downing as deliberate; he confronts Belters about that and kills one of them in a standoff. Holden, guided by Miller, enters an alien structure near the settlement and removes a root growing through a panel, activating the structure; this triggers a pattern of lightning strikes across Ilus. Amos begins a relationship with Chandra Wei, Murtry's second-in-command. On Medina, Ashford and Drummer investigate the disappearance of the UN colony ship ''Sojourner'' and find it was stolen by Marco Inaros, an OPA pirate and Naomi's former lover.

Avasarala's aides uncover a nepotistic scheme that benefited Gao in her career; Avasarala has evidence of it discreetly leaked. On Mars, Bobbie learns that the gang has kidnapped David and forced him to work off the debt incurred from her destruction of their lab. Detective Esai Martin, the gang's ringleader, agrees to release David if Bobbie helps them steal military equipment from her workplace. After she eventually complies, Esai releases him. She declines Esai's offer to join his gang. On Ilus, lightning strikes the settlement, damaging the Belters' power generation infrastructure; Amos and Naomi help them repair it. Murtry identifies the Belters responsible for the downing and orders their execution. Holden, accompanied by Alex and RCE biologist Dr. Elvi Okoye, finds another alien structure that was activated; it is displacing wide swathes of ground while moving toward the settlement. Despite Okoye's protests, Holden has Alex destroy the structure with a torpedo from the ''Rocinante''.

| ShortSummary    = Drummer and Ashford apprehend Marco Inaros for stealing the ''Sojourner'' and executing its passengers. Drummer, Ashford and three other OPA faction leaders hold a trial for Inaros; he appeals to Belter solidarity, offers them the money he made from the ''Sojourner'' and promises to abide by the truce with the Inners. They acquit him by the three to two vote; Drummer, who votes last, chooses to acquit him to prevent division among the OPA, despite hating Inaros for hurting Naomi. On Mars, Bobbie quits her job after attempting to report material theft to her supervisor, only to find out that he is interested in selling more stolen goods. Shortly after, she is arrested for abetting the crime, presumably at the direction of her supervisor. Her charges are dropped once she accepts Esai's offer. On Ilus, Naomi tries to help Dr. Lucia Mazur, a Belter complicit in the downing, escape from Murtry and his forces; Amos gets arrested by Murtry while helping them. Murtry eventually backs down when Holden and Alex intervene and fire the ''Rocinante'''s PDCs at his forces. Naomi, Alex, and Lucia go into orbit aboard the ship while Holden remains on Ilus.

| ShortSummary    = Avasarala and Gao's first public debate, during which Avasarala's attempt to use accusations of nepotism against Gao backfires, is cut short by a security threat; an unidentified ship, initially claiming to be a civilian ship experiencing a system failure, has diverted course toward an Earth asteroid defense platform and gone silent. After the ship is identified as the ''Sojourner'', Avasarala orders its destruction. On Ilus, the Earthers and Belters face off in a tense showdown. Holden reveals his alien connection and reactivation of the alien technology to the settlers to convince both factions into leaving Ilus, but it only further inflames the situation. However, Murtry releases Amos as he also wants Belters to leave Ilus and perceives that his interests are now aligned with Holden's. Lucia and her husband, Jakob, have an argument over her part in the downing of the RCE shuttle and their family falling apart. Feeling guilty, Lucia attempts suicide; Alex saves her, and Naomi counsels her on dealing with guilt, drawing from her own past. An island on the other side of Ilus explodes, causing a shock wave to begin traversing the planet's surface.

| ShortSummary    = Alex and Naomi inform Holden of the explosion and an impending earthquake; it will be followed by a shock wave, and then a [[tsunami]] that will destroy the settlement and flood the continent. Once privy to this knowledge, the settlers finally consent to evacuate Ilus; the Belters only do so after Holden agrees to vouch for their claim on the planet to the UN and Avasarala, which antagonizes Murtry. The explosion prompts Ilus' defenses to shut down the fusion reactors on orbiting ships; the evacuation shuttle from the ''Israel'' gets incinerated mid-descent. Unable to leave the planet, the settlers take shelter in the nearby alien structure; some are killed by the shock wave during the evacuation; the surrounding area gets flooded. On Mars, Bobbie succeeds in her new job for the gang. During a heist, she risks her life to complete the mission, impressing Esai. UNN officers visit Medina and criticize Drummer for mishandling the issue of the ''Sojourner'' and Marco Inaros. Drummer and Ashford receive evidence that Inaros is involved with someone on Mars and that he is currently on the Belter ship ''Pizzouza''.

| ShortSummary    = On Ilus, the Earthers and the Belters set up separate camps inside the alien structure. Everyone besides Holden, who is immune, has been infected with microorganisms that are growing in their eyes; Okoye determines that the microorganisms will cause blindness. Settlers also start being killed by neurotoxic "slugs" that are growing along and crawling out of the structure's walls from the Ilus oceans. Murtry plans to outlast the Belters and plots against Holden. Amidst the fusion shutdown, Lucia devises a solution to keep the ''Barbapiccola'' from falling out of orbit: tethering the ship to the ''Rocinante''. On Earth, Avasarala is upset over her dwindling support in the poll numbers. After receiving the video evidence of Inaros' location from the OPA, she orders a team of UN marines to board the ''Pizzouza'' and capture Inaros alive with minimal casualties, but he is not found; a firefight breaks out before the ship explodes, killing everyone aboard.

In order to salvage her reelection campaign, she leaks images of the environmental disasters on Ilus, but gets confronted by her husband Arjun for putting her pride above the interest of others. Drummer resigns from her position, upset over Fred Johnson giving the evidence of Inaros' location to Earth. Ashford plans to independently hunt down and kill Inaros; Drummer, weary of politics, declines Ashford's offer to join him. On Mars, with the gang's upcoming job paying a lot and having many unknowns, Bobbie raises her concerns to Esai, but he discounts them as he needs money to make his family's life better. The crews of the ''Rocinante'' and the ''Barbapiccola'' successfully tether their ships to one another. In the alien structure, the settlers are all blind now, except for Holden; more Belters die when they wander off. Amos has a nervous breakdown over his powerlessness. Okoye determines that Holden is immune because of his anticancer medication (which he has been taking since absorbing radiation on Eros). She prepares a cure and the settlers regain sight. Holden finally sees Miller again, but Miller appears to be glitching in and out.

Alex destroys the shuttle, but the resultant debris damages many of the ''Rocinante's''thrusters; Lucia is knocked into space but is saved by Naomi. Alex uses the ship's railgun as a makeshift thruster to maintain orbit. Miller, who can now intermittently overcome his protomolecule programming, leads Holden to an artifact that can shut down all of protomolecule activity on Ilus; this artifact, having the form of an energy circle, was presumably left by the species that killed the protomolecule's creators. Murtry and Wei follow Holden, but they are in turn followed by Amos and Okoye. Wei confronts Amos; when neither stands down, Amos kills Wei while Murtry shoots and disables Amos, blowing his fingers off. Okoye finds Holden near the artifact and tells him what happened. Holden goes back for Amos and confronts Murtry; after a standoff, Holden manages to disarm Murtry, though both are wounded. Miller communicates with Okoye and creates a metal mechanical body for himself to go through the energy circle. Despite the structure's attacks on them, Okoye helps Miller reach the artifact, through which they both fall.

The settlers on Ilus decide to stay, planning to together rebuild the settlement and continue research. Murtry and Lucia are to stand trial for their respective crimes, but Holden sets Lucia free. While the ''Israel'' remains in orbit, the ''Rocinante'' and the ''Barbapiccola'' head back to the Solar System. Holden destroys the last piece of protomolecule still on the ''Rocinante'' which Miller had informed him of. On Earth, Gao wins the election; Avasarala is being sent to Luna but Arjun, still angry with her, stays on Earth. On Mars, Bobbie's gang gets ambushed; Esai and most other members are killed. Bobbie notifies Avasarala of Martians trafficking military weapons with Belters and accepts her job offer. Ashford learns of the trafficking himself before finding Inaros and boarding his ship. After a firefight between their crews, Ashford corners Inaros, only to be ambushed by Filip, Inaros' right hand and his and Naomi's son. Inaros kills Ashford, but Ashford manages to secretly record their last conversation. Inaros launches asteroids cloaked with Martian stealth technology at Earth.
