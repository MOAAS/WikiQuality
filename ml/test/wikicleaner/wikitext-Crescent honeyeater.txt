The '''crescent honeyeater''' (''Phylidonyris pyrrhopterus'') is a [[passerine]] bird of the honeyeater family [[Meliphagidae]] native to southeastern [[Fauna of Australia|Australia]]. A member of the genus ''[[Phylidonyris]]'', it is most closely related to the common [[New Holland honeyeater]] (''P. novaehollandiae'') and the [[white-cheeked honeyeater]] (''P. niger''). Two subspecies are recognized, with ''P. p. halmaturinus'' restricted in range to [[Kangaroo Island]] and the [[Mount Lofty Ranges]] in [[South Australia]].

It has dark grey [[plumage]] and paler underparts, highlighted by yellow wing-patches and a broad, black crescent, outlined in white, down the sides of its breast. The species exhibits slight [[sexual dimorphism]], with the female being duller in colour than the male. Juvenile birds are similar to the female, though the yellow wing-patches of male nestlings can be easily distinguished.

The male has a complex and variable [[bird vocalization|song]], which is heard throughout the year. It sings from an exposed perch, and during the breeding season performs song flights. The crescent honeyeater is found in areas of dense vegetation including [[sclerophyll]] forest and [[Alpine plant|alpine]] habitats, as well as [[heath]]land, and parks and gardens, where its diet is made up of [[nectar]] and [[invertebrate]]s. It forms [[pair bond|long-term pairs]], and often stays committed to one breeding site for several years. The female builds the [[nest]] and does most of the caring for the two to three young, which become [[fledge|independent]] within 40 days of laying its egg.

The parent birds use a range of anti-predator strategies, but nestlings can be taken by snakes, [[kookaburra]]s, [[currawong]]s, or cats. While the crescent honeyeater faces a number of threats, its population numbers and distribution are sufficient for it to be listed as of ''[[Least Concern]]'' for conservation.

==Taxonomy==
The crescent honeyeater was originally described by ornithologist [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] in 1801 as ''Certhia pyrrhoptera'', because of an assumed relationship with the [[treecreeper]]s ''Certhia''.<ref>{{cite book| author=Latham, John|author-link=John Latham (ornithologist)|year=1801|title=Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae|location=London |publisher=G.

While both subspecies have the same general appearance, the female of ''halmaturinus'' has paler plumage than the nominate race, and both male and female have a smaller wing and tail and longer bill. The ''halmaturinus'' population on Kangaroo Island has a significantly shorter wing and longer bill than the Mount Lofty population, although this size variation of an [[Island|insular]] form is at odds with [[Allen's rule|Allen's]] and [[Bergmann's rule|Bergmann's]] rules.<ref name = HANZAB />

===Vocalisation===
The crescent honeyeater has a range of musical calls and songs.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Crescent Honeyeater Male.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Male crescent honeyeater feeding on a flower in a dense Correa shrub|Feeding in a ''[[Correa (plant)|Correa]]'' shrub]]
There are records of scattered populations of the crescent honeyeater on the [[Central Tablelands]], the [[Mid North Coast]], and in the [[Hunter Region]] of [[New South Wales]], and it is widespread in the areas of New South Wales south of [[Dharug National Park]] and east of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]]. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] it is widespread across an area from the NSW border south west to [[Wallan, Victoria|Wallan]] with scattered populations recorded further west. It is widespread in [[Tasmania]], except in the northeastern part of the state where it is more sparsely distributed. It is restricted to sclerophyll forest in eastern South Australia,<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Ford, Hugh A. |author2=Paton, David C. |year=1977|title=The Comparative Ecology of Ten Species of Honeyeaters in South Australia|journal=Austral Ecology|volume=2|issue=4|pages=399–407|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1977.tb01155.x}}</ref> where isolated populations have been recorded in the [[Mount Lofty Ranges]] and on [[Kangaroo Island]]. Local influxes have occurred outside its normal range in response to changes in habitat. Recorded population densities range from {{convert|0.3|/ha||adj=pre|birds}} near [[Orbost, Victoria|Orbost]], to {{convert|8.7|/ha||adj=pre|pairs}} in [[Boola Boola State Forest]], also in Victoria.<ref name = HANZAB />

While the crescent honeyeater occupies a wide variety of habitats including coastal [[Heath (habitat)|heath]], [[rainforest]], wet [[sclerophyll]] forest, mountain forest, [[Alpine climate|alpine]] [[woodland]], damp gullies and thick [[Melaleuca|tea-tree]] scrub, they all demonstrate its preference for dense vegetation.<ref name=HANZAB /> It has been frequently recorded in wet sclerophyll forest dominated by [[eucalypt]]s and with a thick mid-story and [[understory]] of shrubs such as [[Acacia melanoxylon|blackwood]], [[Acacia dealbata|silver wattle]], ''[[Cassinia]]'', ''[[Prostanthera]]'', and ''[[Correa (plant)|Correa]]''. At higher altitudes it occurs in alpine heathlands and in woodlands of stunted eucalypt or conifers.<ref name =HANZAB />

The movements of the crescent honeyeater within its range are incompletely known. There is widespread evidence of seasonal migration to lower altitudes in cooler months, yet a proportion of the population remains sedentary.<ref name =HANZAB /> Autumn and winter migration to the lowland coastal areas is seen in southern Tasmania, where it is not unusual to see it in urban parks and gardens,<ref name=Ber93 /> as well as in [[Gippsland]], and the New South Wales [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central]] and [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]]. In the Sydney region, some birds appear to move down from the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] to Sydney for the cooler months, yet others remain in either location for the whole year. It is only seen in alpine and subalpine areas of the [[Snowy Mountains]] in warmer snow-free months (mainly October to April). Other populations of crescent honeyeaters follow a more nomadic pattern of following food sources; this has been recorded in the Blue Mountains and parts of Victoria.<ref name =HANZAB /><!-- cites previous four sentences -->

===Breeding===
Crescent honeyeaters occupy territories during the breeding season of July to March, with pairs often staying on in the territory at the end of the season and committing to one breeding site for several years.<ref name=HANZAB /> [[Bird ringing|Banding]] studies have recaptured birds within metres of the nest in which they were raised, and one female was re-trapped at the banding place almost ten years later.<ref name = HANZAB /> The pairs nest solitarily, or in loose colonies with nests around {{convert|10|m|ft}} apart. The male defends the territory, which is used both for foraging and breeding, though during the breeding season he is more active in protecting the area, and therefore much more vocal. During courtship the male performs song flights, soaring with quivering wings and continuously calling with a high piping note.<ref name=Clarke99 />

The female builds the nest close to the boundary of the territory, usually near water, low in the shrubs. It is a deep, cup-shaped, bulky nest of cobweb, bark, grass, twigs, roots and other plant materials, lined with grass, down, moss, and fur.<ref name=Ber93>{{cite book | last = Beruldsen | first = Gordon | author-link=Gordon Beruldsen|title = Australian Birds: Their Nests and Eggs | publisher = self | year = 2003 | location = Kenmore Hills, Queensland | pages = 322–23 |isbn = 0-646-42798-9}}</ref> The long strips of bark from [[stringybark]] or [[messmate]] trees are often used.<ref name="Dickison" /> The [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] size is 2 or 3, occasionally 4. Measuring {{convert|19|mm|in}} by {{convert|15|mm|in}}, the eggs are pale pink, sometimes buff-tinged, with lavender and chestnut splotches. The base colour is darker at the larger end.<ref name=Ber93 /> The female [[Egg incubation#Avian incubation|incubates]] and broods the eggs, but both sexes feed the nestlings and remove [[faecal sac]]s, although the female does the majority of caring for the young. The young birds are fed [[insectivore|insects]], with flies making up much of the regurgitated material, according to one study.<ref name=Clarke99>{{cite journal |author1=Clarke, Rohan H. |author2=Clarke, Michael F. |year=1999 |title=The Social Organization of a Sexually Dimorphic Honeyeater: the Crescent Honeyeater ''Philydonyris pyrrhoptera''at Wilson's Promontory, Victoria |journal=Australian Journal of Ecology |volume=24 |pages=644–54 |doi=10.1046/j.1442-9993.1999.00990.x |issue=6}}</ref> The incubation period is 13 days, followed by a fledging period of 13 days. The parent birds feed the fledglings for around two weeks after they leave the nest, but the young do not remain long in the parents' territory.<ref name=Clarke00 /> The young are independent within 40 days of egg-laying.<ref name=Clarke00 />

Parent birds have been observed using a range of anti-[[predation|predator]] strategies: the female staying on the nest until almost touched; one or other of the pair performing distraction displays, fluttering wings and moving across the ground; the female flying rapidly at the intruder; and both birds giving harsh scolding calls when a [[kookaburra]], [[tiger snake]] or [[currawong]] approached.<ref name=Clarke99 /> The nests of the crescent honeyeater are usually low in the shrubs, which makes them and their young vulnerable to predation by snakes and other birds; however, domestic and feral cats are the most likely predators to hunt this species.<ref name =ANBG />

Crescent honeyeaters pair in long-term relationships that often last for the whole year; however, while they are socially [[Monogamy|monogamous]], they appear to be sexually [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]]. One study found that only 42% of the nestlings were sired by the male partner at the nest, despite [[Parent|paternity]] guards such as pairing and territorial defence.<ref name="Ewen">{{cite journal |author1=Ewen, John G. |author2=Ciborowski, Kate L. |author3=Clarke, Rohan H. |author4=Boulton, Rebecca L. |author5=Clarke, Michael F. | year = 2008| title = Evidence of Extra-pair Paternity in Two Socially Monogamous Australian Passerines: the Crescent Honeyeater and the Yellow-faced Honeyeater | journal = Emu | volume =108| pages =133–37 | doi =10.1071/MU07040 |issue= 2|s2cid=85028730 }}</ref> The crescent honeyeaters observed exhibited a number of characteristics consistent with genetic promiscuity: sexual dimorphism, with sex-specific plumages identifiable at nestling stage; reduced male contribution to feeding and caring for the young; vigorous defence of the territory by the male; and frequent intrusions into other territories by females which were tolerated by the males holding those territories.<ref name="Ewen" />

===Feeding===
The crescent honeyeater is arboreal,<ref name = HANZAB /> foraging mainly among the foliage and flowers in the [[understory]] and tree canopy on nectar, fruits and small insects.<ref name=ford77 /> It has been recorded eating the [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] of [[psyllidae|psyllids]], [[Coccidae|soft scale]] and [[Eriococcidae|felt scale insects]].<ref name =HANZAB /> It feeds primarily by probing flowers for nectar, and [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] foliage and bark and [[Hawking (birds)|sallying]] for insects.<ref name =HANZAB /> While regularly observed feeding singly or in pairs, the crescent honeyeater has also been recorded moving in loose feeding flocks, and gathering in large groups at productive food sources.<ref name =HANZAB /> A study in forest near [[Hobart]] in Tasmania found that the crescent honeyeater's diet was wholly composed of insects during the breeding season, while nectar was a significant component during winter. Insects consumed included moths and flies. Tree-trunks were the site of foraging around two-thirds of the time, and foliage a third. It fed on nectar as plants came into flower in the autumn and winter, and then foraged in Tasmanian blue gum (''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]'') during the breeding season in spring.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=D.G. | year = 1980| title = Foraging of Honeyeaters in an Area of Tasmanian Sclerophyll Forest | journal = Emu | volume =80 | issue =2 | pages =55–58 | doi =10.1071/MU9800055 | url= http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/MU9800055.htm}}</ref> The flowering of royal grevillea (''[[Grevillea victoriae]]'') over summer in subalpine areas in the [[Snowy Mountains]] attracted large numbers of crescent honeyeaters.<ref name =HANZAB /> It feeds intensively when sources are plentiful and, when feeding on flame heath (''[[Astroloma conostephioides]]''), it was recorded visiting an average of 34 flowers per minute.<ref name =ford77>{{cite journal|last=Ford|first=Hugh A.|year=1977|title=The Ecology of Honeyeaters in South Australia|journal=South Australian Ornithologist|volume=27|pages=199–203|issn= 0038-2973 }}</ref> Other plants it has been recorded visiting include a number of ''[[Banksia]]'' species,<ref name="Taylor 1988">{{cite book|last = Taylor| first = Anne|author2=Hopper, Stephen |author-link2=Stephen Hopper | title = The Banksia Atlas|publisher = Australian Government Publishing Service| series = Australian Flora and Fauna Series|volume = 8| year = 1988| location = Canberra|pages =98, 152, 184, 212, 214, 226| isbn =0-644-07124-9}}</ref> waratah (''[[Waratah|Telopea]]''),<ref>{{cite book|last=Nixon|first=Paul|title=The Waratah|publisher=Kangaroo Press|location=East Roseville, New South Wales|year=1997|orig-year=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-86417-878-6}} plate 3.</ref> tubular flowered genera including ''[[Astroloma]]'', ''[[Epacris]]'' and ''[[Correa (plant)|Correa]]'', mistletoes of the genus ''[[Amyema]]'', and eucalypts in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia.<ref name=ford77 /> In [[Bondi State Forest]] it was also recorded feeding at cluster-flower geebung (''[[Persoonia confertiflora]]''), native holly (''[[Lomatia ilicifolia]]''), tall shaggy-pea (''[[Oxylobium arborescens]]''), silver wattle (''[[Acacia dealbata]]'') and blackthorn (''[[Bursaria spinosa]]'').<ref name =HANZAB /> Local differences in flower foraging patterns have been observed in South Australia; populations on Kangaroo Island forage more often at ''[[Adenanthos]]'' flowers than those in the nearby [[Fleurieu Peninsula]], while the latter forage more often at eucalypt blooms, and at a higher diversity of plants overall.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ford |first=Hugh A. |year=1976 |title=The Honeyeaters of Kangaroo Island |journal=South Australian Ornithologist |volume=27 |pages=134–38 |url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/SAOpdf/Volume%2027/1976V27P134.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127182521/http://www.birdssa.asn.au/SAOpdf/Volume%2027/1976V27P134.pdf |archive-date=2012-01-27 }}</ref>

==Conservation status==
While the population numbers and distribution are sufficient for the crescent honeyeater to be listed as of ''[[Least Concern]]'' for conservation,<ref name="iucn status 19 November 2021" /> numbers have fluctuated significantly over the past twenty-five years and currently seem to be in decline.<ref name =HANZAB /> The threats to the crescent honeyeater include habitat destruction, as the alpine forests in which it breeds are being reduced by weed infestations, severe bushfires, drought and land-clearing. The crescent honeyeater's dependence on long-term partnerships and breeding territories means that breeding success is threatened by the death of one partner or the destruction of habitual territory. The influx of birds to urban areas also places them at increased risk of accidents and predation.<ref name =ANBG /> Cats have been recorded preying on crescent honeyeaters,<ref name = HANZAB /> and at least one guide urges cat owners to keep their cats in enclosures when outside the house or to provide a stimulating indoor environment for them.<ref name =ANBG />
