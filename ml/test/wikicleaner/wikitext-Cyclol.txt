[[File:Cyclol reaction.png|thumb|350px|right|Figure 1: In the classic cyclol reaction, two peptide groups are linked by a N-C' bond, converting the carbonyl oxygen into a hydroxyl group. Although this reaction occurs in a few cyclic peptides, it is disfavored by [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], mainly because it eliminates the [[resonance stabilization]] of the [[peptide bond]]. This reaction was the basis of [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch's]] cyclol model of proteins.]]

The '''cyclol hypothesis''' is the first [[tertiary structure|structural model]] of a [[protein folding|folded]], [[globular protein|globular]] [[protein]], formulated in the 1930s<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tiselius A | author-link = Arne Tiselius | year = 1939 | title = The Chemistry of Proteins and Amino Acids | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 8 | pages = 155&ndash;184 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.08.070139.001103}}</ref> and since discredited.  It was based on the [[cyclol reaction]] of peptide bonds proposed by physicist [[Frederick Charles Frank|Frederick Frank]] in 1936,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = F.

These crosslinks are covalent analogs of the non-covalent [[hydrogen bond]]s between peptide groups and have been observed in rare cases, such as the [[ergoline|ergopeptides]].    

Based on this reaction, mathematician [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]] hypothesized in a series of five papers in the late 1930s a structural model of globular proteins.  She postulated that, under some conditions, amino acids will spontaneously make the maximum possible number of cyclol crosslinks, resulting in '''cyclol molecules''' and '''cyclol fabrics'''.  She further proposed that globular proteins have a [[tertiary structure]] corresponding to [[Platonic solid]]s and [[semiregular polyhedron|semiregular polyhedra]] formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges. In contrast to the cyclol reaction itself, these hypothetical molecules, fabrics and polyhedra have not been observed experimentally.  The model has several consequences that render it energetically implausible, such as steric clashes between the protein sidechains.  In response to such criticisms [[J. D. Bernal]] proposed that [[hydrophobic interaction]]s are chiefly responsible for [[protein folding]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernal JD | author-link = J. D.

==Historical context==
By the mid-1930s, [[analytical ultracentrifugation]] studies by [[Theodor Svedberg]] had shown that proteins had a well-defined chemical structure, and were not aggregations of small molecules.<ref name="svedberg_1929">{{cite journal | vauthors = Svedberg T | author-link = Theodor Svedberg | year = 1929 | title = Mass and size of protein molecules | journal = Nature | volume = 123 | pages = 871 | doi = 10.1038/123871a0 | issue=3110|bibcode = 1929Natur.123..871S | s2cid = 4068088 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The same studies appeared to show that the molecular weight of proteins fell into a few well-defined classes related by integers,<ref name="svedberg_1934">{{cite journal | vauthors = Svedberg T | author-link = Theodor Svedberg | year = 1934 | title = Sedimentation of molecules in centrifugal fields | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 14 | pages = 1&ndash;15 | doi = 10.1021/cr60047a001}}</ref> such as ''M''<sub>''w''</sub> = 2<sup>''p''</sup>3<sup>''q''</sup>&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|Da]], where ''p'' and ''q'' are nonnegative integers.<ref name="bergmann_niemann_1937">{{cite journal| vauthors = Bergmann M, Niemann C | year = 1937 | title = On the structure of proteins: cattle hemoglobin, egg albumin, cattle fibrin, and gelatin | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 118 | pages = 301&ndash;314| doi = 10.1016/S0021-9258(18)74540-7 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, it was difficult to determine the exact molecular weight and number of amino acids in a protein.

==Basic theory==
[[File:Cyclol 6 molecule.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2: The alanine cyclol-6 molecule proposed by [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]] is a cyclic hexapeptide in which three [[peptide bond|peptide groups]] are fused by cyclol reactions into a central ring. The three outer (unfused) peptide groups are not planar, but have dihedral angle ω=60°. The three red atoms in the central ring represent the hydroxyl groups formed by the cyclol reactions, whereas the three outer red atoms represent the oxygens of carbonyl groups. The inner oxygen atoms are separated by only 2.45&nbsp;[[Angstrom|Å]], which is extremely close even for [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] [[atom]]s. This hypothetical molecule has not been observed in nature.]]

[[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Wrinch]] developed this suggestion into a full-fledged model of [[protein structure]]. The basic cyclol model was laid out in her first paper (1936).<ref name=":0">{{cite journal| vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | title = The Pattern of Proteins | year = 1936 | journal = Nature | volume = 137 | pages = 411&ndash;412 | doi = 10.1038/137411a0 | issue=3462 | bibcode=1936Natur.137..411W| s2cid = 4140591 }}</ref> She noted the possibility that [[polypeptide]]s might cyclize to form closed rings ([[cyclic peptide|true]]) and that these rings might form internal crosslinks through the cyclol reaction (also true, although rare). Assuming that the cyclol form of the [[peptide bond]] could be more stable than the amide form, Wrinch concluded that certain cyclic [[peptide]]s would naturally make the maximal number of cyclol bonds (such as '''cyclol 6''', Figure 2).<ref name=":0" /> Such cyclol molecules would have hexagonal symmetry, if the [[chemical bond]]s were taken as having the same length, roughly 1.5&nbsp;[[Angstrom|Å]]; for comparison, the N-C and C-C bonds have the lengths 1.42&nbsp;Å and 1.54&nbsp;Å, respectively.<ref name=":0" />

These rings can be extended indefinitely to form a '''cyclol fabric''' (Figure 3).<ref name=":5" /> Such fabrics exhibit a long-range, quasi-crystalline order that Wrinch felt was likely in proteins, since they must pack hundreds of residues densely. Another interesting feature of such molecules and fabrics is that their [[amino acid|amino-acid]] side chains point axially upwards from only one face; the opposite face has no side chains. Thus, one face is completely independent of the [[primary sequence]] of the peptide, which Wrinch conjectured might account for sequence-independent properties of proteins.<ref name=":5" />

In her initial article, Wrinch stated clearly that the cyclol model was merely a ''working hypothesis'', a potentially valid model of proteins that would have to be checked.<ref name=":0" /> Her goals in this article and its successors were to propose a well-defined testable model, to work out the consequences of its assumptions and to make predictions that could be tested experimentally.<ref name=":1" /> In these goals, she succeeded; however, within a few years, experiments and further modeling showed that the cyclol hypothesis was untenable as a model for globular proteins.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> 

==Stabilizing energies==
[[File:Cyclol fabric stick CBside.png|thumb|left|350px|Figure 3: Stick model of the alanine cyclol fabric proposed by [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]]. The cyclol fabric is conceptually similar to a [[beta sheet]], but more uniform and laterally denser. The fabric has large "lacunae" arranged in a hexagonal pattern, in which three C<sup>β</sup> atoms (shown in green) and three H<sup>α</sup> atoms (shown in white) converge on a (relatively) empty spot in the fabric. The two sides of the fabric are not equivalent; all the C<sup>β</sup> atoms emerge from the same side, which is the "upper" side here. The red atoms represent hydroxyl groups (not carbonyl groups) and emerge (in sets of three) from both sides of the fabric; the blue atoms represent nitrogen.

A relatively simple calculation showed that the cyclol form is significantly ''less'' stable than the amide form. Therefore, the cyclol model would have to be abandoned unless a compensating source of energy could be identified. Initially, Frank proposed that the cyclol form might be stabilized by better interactions with the surrounding solvent; later, Wrinch and [[Irving Langmuir]] hypothesized that hydrophobic association of nonpolar sidechains provides stabilizing energy to overcome the energetic cost of the cyclol reactions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Langmuir I, Wrinch DM | author-link = Irving Langmuir |author-link2=Dorothy Maud Wrinch  | year = 1939 | title = Nature of the Cyclol Bond | journal = Nature | volume = 143 | pages = 49&ndash;52 | doi = 10.1038/143049a0 | issue=3611|bibcode = 1939Natur.143...49L | s2cid = 4056966 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Langmuir I | author-link = Irving Langmuir | year = 1939 | title = The Structure of Proteins | journal = Proceedings of the Physical Society | volume = 51 | pages = 592&ndash;612 | doi = 10.1088/0959-5309/51/4/305 | issue = 4|bibcode = 1939PPS....51..592L }}</ref>

The lability of the cyclol bond was seen as an ''advantage'' of the model, since it provided a natural explanation for the properties of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]]; reversion of cyclol bonds to their more stable amide form would open up the structure and allows those bonds to be attacked by [[protease]]s, consistent with experiment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1938 | title = On the Hydration and Denaturation of Proteins | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 25 | pages = 705&ndash;739}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1936 | title = Hydration and Denaturation of Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 142 | pages = 260 | doi = 10.1038/142259a0 | issue = 3588|bibcode = 1938Natur.142..259. | doi-access = free }}</ref> Early studies showed that proteins [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by [[pressure]] are often in a different state than the same proteins denatured by high [[temperature]], which was interpreted as possibly supporting the cyclol model of denaturation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dow RB, Matthews Jr JE, Thorp WT  | year = 1940 | title = The Effect of High Pressure Treatment on the Physiological Activity of Insulin | journal = American Journal of Physiology | volume = 131 | issue = 2 | pages = 382&ndash;387| doi = 10.1152/ajplegacy.1940.131.2.382 }}</ref>

The Langmuir-Wrinch hypothesis of hydrophobic stabilization shared in the downfall of the cyclol model, owing mainly to the influence of [[Linus Pauling]], who favored the hypothesis that protein structure was stabilized by [[hydrogen bond]]s. Another twenty years had to pass before hydrophobic interactions were recognized as the chief driving force in protein folding.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kauzmann W | title = Some factors in the interpretation of protein denaturation | journal = Advances in Protein Chemistry | volume = 14 | pages = 1–63 | year = 1959 | pmid = 14404936 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-3233(08)60608-7 | isbn = 978-0-12-034214-3 | author-link = Walter Kauzmann }}</ref>

Wrinch proposed that steric complementarity was one of chief factors in determining whether a small molecule would bind to a protein.{{Cn|date=March 2022}}

Wrinch speculated that proteins are responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules. Noting that cells digest their proteins only under extreme starvation conditions, Wrinch further speculated that life could not exist without proteins.{{Cn|date=March 2022}}

==Hybrid models==
From the beginning, the cyclol reaction was considered as a covalent analog of the [[hydrogen bond]]. Therefore, it was natural to consider hybrid models with both types of bonds. This was the subject of Wrinch's fourth paper on the cyclol model (1936),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM, Jordan Lloyd D  | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch |author-link2=Dorothy Jordan Lloyd  | year = 1936 | title = The Hydrogen Bond and the Structure of Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 138 | pages = 758&ndash;759 | doi = 10.1038/138758a0 | issue=3496|bibcode = 1936Natur.138..758W | s2cid = 4096438 }}</ref> written together with [[Dorothy Jordan Lloyd]], who first proposed that globular proteins are stabilized by hydrogen bonds.<ref name="jordan_lloyd_1932" /> A follow-up paper was written in 1937 that referenced other researchers on hydrogen bonding in proteins, such as [[Maurice Loyal Huggins]] and [[Linus Pauling]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = Nature of the Linkage in Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 139 | pages = 718 | doi = 10.1038/139718a0 | issue=3521|bibcode = 1937Natur.139..718W | s2cid = 4116000 }}</ref>

Wrinch also wrote a paper with [[William Astbury]], noting the possibility of a keto-enol isomerization of the >C<sup>α</sup>H<sup>α</sup> and an amide carbonyl group >C=O, producing a crosslink >C<sup>α</sup>-C(OH<sup>α</sup>)< and again converting the oxygen to a hydroxyl group.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Astbury WT, Wrinch DM | author-link = William Astbury |author-link2=Dorothy Maud Wrinch  | year = 1937 | title = Intramolecular Folding of Proteins by Keto-Enol Interchange | journal = Nature | volume = 139 | pages = 798 | bibcode=   1937Natur.139..798A| doi = 10.1038/139798a0 | issue=3523| s2cid = 41311699 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Such reactions could yield five-membered rings, whereas the classic cyclol hypothesis produces six-membered rings.

==Space-enclosing fabrics==
[[File:Cyclol C1 molecule lacuna.png|thumb|right|350px|Figure 4: Stick model of the cyclol C<sub>1</sub> protein structure proposed by [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]]. The molecule is a truncated tetrahedron composed of four planar cyclol fabrics, each surrounding one lacuna (48 residues), and joined together pairwise by four residues along each edge (two residues at each corner). Thus, this molecule has 72 [[amino acid|amino-acid]] residues altogether.  It is viewed here "face-on", i.e., looking into the lacuna of one cyclol fabric. The side chains (taken here as alanine) all point into the interior of this "cage-like" structure. This hypothetical structure has not been observed in nature.]]

In her fifth paper on cyclols (1937),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = The Cyclol Theory and the 'Globular' Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 139 | pages = 972&ndash;973 | doi = 10.1038/139972a0 | issue=3527|bibcode = 1937Natur.139..972W | s2cid = 4066210 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Wrinch identified the conditions under which two planar cyclol fabrics could be joined to make an angle between their planes while respecting the chemical bond angles. She identified a mathematical simplification, in which the non-planar six-membered rings of atoms can be represented by planar "median hexagon"s made from the midpoints of the chemical bonds. This "median hexagon" representation made it easy to see that the cyclol fabric planes can be joined correctly if the [[dihedral angle]] between the planes equals the tetrahedral bond angle δ = arccos(-1/3) ≈ 109.47°.{{Cn|date=March 2022}}

A large variety of closed polyhedra meeting this criterion can be constructed, of which the simplest are the [[truncated tetrahedron]], the [[truncated octahedron]], and the [[octahedron]], which are [[Platonic solid]]s or [[semiregular polyhedron|semiregular polyhedra]]. Considering the first series of "closed cyclols" (those modeled on the truncated tetrahedron), Wrinch showed that their number of amino acids [[quadratic growth|increased quadratically]] as 72''n''<sup>2</sup>, where ''n'' is the index of the closed cyclol ''C<sub>n</sub>''. Thus, the ''C<sub>1</sub>'' cyclol has 72 residues, the ''C<sub>2</sub>'' cyclol has 288 residues, etc. Preliminary experimental support for this prediction came from [[Max Bergmann]] and [[Carl Niemann]],<ref name="bergmann_niemann_1937" /> whose amino-acid analyses suggested that proteins were composed of integer multiples of 288 [[amino acid|amino-acid]] residues (''n''=2). More generally, the cyclol model of globular proteins accounted for the early [[analytical ultracentrifugation]] results of [[Theodor Svedberg]], which suggested that the [[molecular weight]]s of proteins fell into a few classes related by integers.<ref name="svedberg_1929" /><ref name="svedberg_1934" />

The cyclol model was consistent with the general properties then attributed to folded proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch D | title = The Native Protein | journal = Science | volume = 106 | issue = 2743 | pages = 73–76 | date = July 1947 | pmid = 17808858 | doi = 10.1126/science.106.2743.73 | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | bibcode = 1947Sci...106...73W }}</ref> (1) Centrifugation studies had shown that folded proteins were significantly denser than water (~1.4&nbsp;[[gram|g]]/[[liter|mL]]) and, thus, tightly packed; Wrinch assumed that dense packing should imply ''regular'' packing. (2) Despite their large size, some proteins crystallize readily into symmetric crystals, consistent with the idea of symmetric faces that match up upon association. (3) Proteins bind metal ions; since metal-binding sites must have specific bond geometries (e.g., octahedral), it was plausible to assume that the entire protein also had similarly crystalline geometry. (4) As described above, the cyclol model provided a simple ''chemical'' explanation of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] and the difficulty of cleaving folded proteins with proteases. (5) Proteins were assumed to be responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules, including other proteins. Wrinch noted that a fixed, uniform structure would be useful for proteins in templating their own synthesis, analogous to the [[James D. Watson|Watson]]-[[Francis Crick]] concept of DNA templating its own replication. Given that many biological molecules such as [[carbohydrate|sugars]] and [[sterol]]s have a hexagonal structure, it was plausible to assume that their synthesizing proteins likewise had a hexagonal structure. Wrinch summarized her model and the supporting molecular-weight experimental data in three review articles.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = On the Pattern of Proteins | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society | volume = A160 | pages = 59&ndash;86}}<br />{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = The Cyclol Hypothesis and the "Globular" Proteins | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society | volume = A161 | pages = 505&ndash;524}}<br />{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1938 | title = On the Molecular Weights of the Globular Proteins | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 26 | pages = 313&ndash;332}}</ref>

==Predicted protein structures==
Having proposed a model of globular proteins, Wrinch investigated whether it was consistent with the available structural data. She hypothesized that bovine tuberculin protein (523) was a ''C<sub>1</sub>'' closed cyclol consisting of 72 residues<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1939 | title = The Tuberculin Protein TBU-Bovine (523) | journal = Nature | volume = 144 | pages = 77 | doi = 10.1038/144077a0 | issue=3636|bibcode = 1939Natur.144...77W | s2cid = 4113033 }}</ref> and that the digestive [[enzyme]] [[pepsin]] was a ''C<sub>2</sub>'' closed cyclol of 288 residues.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = On the structure of pepsin | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 24 | pages = 940}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wrinch DM | author-link = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1938 | title = Structure of Pepsin | journal = Nature | volume = 142 | pages = 217 | issue = 3587 | doi = 10.1038/142215a0|bibcode = 1938Natur.142..215. | doi-access = free }}</ref> These residue-number predictions were difficult to verify, since the methods then available to measure the mass of proteins were inaccurate, such as [[analytical ultracentrifugation]] and chemical methods.{{Cn|date=March 2022}}

Wrinch also predicted that [[insulin]] was a ''C<sub>2</sub>'' closed cyclol consisting of 288 residues.

Wrinch replied to the steric-clash, free-energy, chemical and residue-number criticisms of the cyclol model.

The downfall of the overall cyclol model generally led to a rejection of its elements; one notable exception was [[J. D. Bernal]]'s short-lived acceptance of the Langmuir-Wrinch hypothesis that [[protein folding]] is driven by hydrophobic association.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernal JD | author-link = J. D.

Clarification of the modern terminology is appropriate. The classic cyclol reaction is the addition of the NH amine of a [[peptide bond|peptide group]] to the C=O carbonyl group of another; the resulting compound is now called an '''azacyclol'''. By analogy, an '''oxacyclol''' is formed when an OH hydroxyl group is added to a peptidyl carbonyl group. Likewise, a '''thiacyclol''' is formed by adding an SH thiol moiety to a peptidyl carbonyl group.<ref name="Wieland1991">Wieland T and Bodanszky M, ''The World of Peptides'', Springer Verlag, pp.193–198.  {{ISBN|0-387-52830-X}}</ref>
