By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids because of a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinking within the fluid that gives a gel its structure (hardness) and contributes to the adhesive stick ([[Adhesive|tack]]). In this way, gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid medium. The word ''gel'' was coined by 19th-century Scottish chemist [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] by [[clipping (morphology)|clipping]] from ''[[gelatine]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gel |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: gel |last=Harper |first=Douglas | name-list-style = vanc |author-link=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |access-date=2013-12-09}}</ref>

The process of forming a gel is called [[gelation]].

==Composition==
Gels consist of a solid three-dimensional network that spans the volume of a liquid medium and ensnares it through [[surface tension]] effects. This internal network structure may result from [[physical bond]]s (physical gels) or [[chemical bond]]s (chemical gels), as well as [[crystallite]]s or other junctions that remain intact within the extending fluid. Virtually any fluid can be used as an extender including water ([[hydrogel]]s), oil, and air ([[aerogel]]). Both by weight and volume, gels are mostly fluid in composition and thus exhibit densities similar to those of their constituent liquids. Edible jelly is a common example of a hydrogel and has approximately the density of water.

===Polyionic polymers===
Polyionic polymers are polymers with an ionic functional group. The ionic charges prevent the formation of tightly coiled polymer chains. This allows them to contribute more to [[viscosity]] in their stretched state, because the stretched-out polymer takes up more space. This is also the reason gel hardens. See [[polyelectrolyte]] for more information.

==Types==

===Hydrogels===

A [[hydrogel]] is a network of polymer chains that are hydrophilic, sometimes found as a [[colloid]]al gel in which water is the dispersion medium. A three-dimensional solid results from the hydrophilic polymer chains being held together by cross-links.{{clarify|reason=What is the nature of the cross-links? Covalent? Hydrogen bonds?|date=March 2019}} Because of the inherent cross-links, the structural integrity of the hydrogel network does not dissolve from the high concentration of water.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Warren DS, Sutherland SP, Kao JY, Weal GR, Mackay SM |date=2017-04-20|title=The Preparation and Simple Analysis of a Clay Nanoparticle Composite Hydrogel|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|language=EN|volume=94|issue=11|pages=1772–1779|doi=10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00389|issn=0021-9584|bibcode=2017JChEd..94.1772W}}</ref> Hydrogels are highly [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] (they can contain over 90% water) natural or synthetic polymeric networks.
Hydrogels also possess a degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue, due to their significant water content. As responsive "[[smart materials]]," hydrogels can encapsulate chemical systems which upon stimulation by external factors such as a change of pH may cause specific compounds such as glucose to be liberated to the environment, in most cases by a [[sol-gel|gel-sol transition]] to the liquid state. Chemomechanical polymers are mostly also hydrogels, which upon stimulation change their volume and can serve as [[actuators]] or [[sensors]]. The first appearance of the term 'hydrogel' in the literature was in 1894.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bemmelen JM |s2cid=197928622|doi=10.1007/BF01830147|title=Der Hydrogel und das kristallinische Hydrat des Kupferoxydes|journal=Zeitschrift für Chemie und Industrie der Kolloide |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=213–214 |year=1907 }}</ref>

===Organogels===
{{See also|Organogels}}

An '''organogel''' is a [[crystallinity|non-crystalline]], [[glass|non-glassy]] thermoreversible ([[thermoplastic]]) solid material composed of a [[liquid]] [[organic compound|organic]] phase entrapped in a three-dimensionally cross-linked network. The liquid can be, for example, an [[organic solvent]], [[mineral oil]], or [[vegetable oil]]. The [[solubility]] and [[wikt:Particle|particle]] dimensions of the structurant are important characteristics for the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] properties and firmness of the organogel. Often, these systems are based on [[self-assembly]] of the structurant molecules.<ref>Terech P. (1997) "Low-molecular weight organogelators", pp. 208–268 in: Robb I.D. (ed.)

===Xerogels===
A '''xerogel''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɪər|oʊ-|ˌ|dʒ|ɛ|l}} is a solid formed from a gel by drying with unhindered shrinkage. Xerogels usually retain high porosity (15–50%) and enormous surface area (150–900 m<sup>2</sup>/g), along with very small [[Porosity|pore]] size (1–10&nbsp;nm). When [[solvent]] removal occurs under [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] conditions, the network does not shrink and a highly porous, low-density material known as an ''[[aerogel]]'' is produced. Heat treatment of a xerogel at elevated temperature produces viscous [[sintering]] (shrinkage of the xerogel due to a small amount of viscous flow) which results in a denser and more robust solid, the density and porosity achieved depend on the sintering conditions.

==Properties==
Many gels display [[thixotropy]] – they become fluid when agitated, but resolidify when resting.
In general, gels are apparently solid, jelly-like materials. It is a type of [[non-Newtonian fluid]].
By replacing the liquid with gas it is possible to prepare [[aerogel]]s, materials with exceptional properties including very low density, [[specific surface area|high specific surface areas]], and excellent thermal insulation properties.


==Animal-produced gels==
Some species secrete gels that are effective in parasite control. For example, the [[long-finned pilot whale]] secretes an enzymatic gel that rests on the outer surface of this animal and helps prevent other organisms from establishing colonies on the surface of these whales' bodies.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Dee EM, McGinley M, Hogan CM | date = 2010 | chapter-url = http://www.eoearth.org/article/Long-finned_pilot_whale?topic=49540 | chapter = Long-finned pilot whale | veditors = Saundry P, Cleveland C | editor-link2 = Cutler J.

[[Hydrogels]] existing naturally in the body include [[mucus]], the [[vitreous humor]] of the eye, [[cartilage]], [[tendons]] and [[blood clots]]. Their viscoelastic nature results in the soft tissue component of the body, disparate from the mineral-based hard tissue of the skeletal system. Researchers are actively developing synthetically derived tissue replacement technologies derived from hydrogels, for both temporary [[Implant (medicine)|implants]] (degradable) and permanent implants (non-degradable). A review article on the subject discusses the use of hydrogels for [[nucleus pulposus]] replacement, cartilage replacement, and [[synthetic tissue]] models.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.orthoworld.com/site/index.php/publications/view_article/221558 |title=Injectable Hydrogel-based Medical Devices: "There's always room for Jell-O"1 |publisher=Orthoworld.com |date=September 15, 2010 |access-date=2013-05-19}}</ref>

==Applications==
Many substances can form gels when a suitable [[Thickening agent|thickener or gelling agent]] is added to their formula. This approach is common in manufacture of wide range of products, from foods to paints and adhesives.

In fiber optic communications, a soft gel resembling [[hair gel]] in viscosity is used to fill the plastic tubes containing the fibers. The main purpose of the gel is to prevent water intrusion if the buffer tube is breached, but the gel also buffers the fibers against mechanical damage when the tube is bent around corners during installation, or flexed. Additionally, the gel acts as a processing aid when the cable is being constructed, keeping the fibers central whilst the tube material is extruded around it.
