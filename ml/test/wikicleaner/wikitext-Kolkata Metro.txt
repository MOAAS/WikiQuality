The '''Kolkata Metro''' ({{lang-bn|কলকাতা মেট্রো}}) is a [[rapid transit]] system serving the city of [[Kolkata]] in [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. As of February 2021, it has two operational lines, a {{convert|31.36|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} line from [[Dakshineswar metro station|Dakshineswar]] to [[Kavi Subhash metro station|Kavi Subhash]] and a {{convert|6.9|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}}<ref name="a">{{cite news|date=4 October 2020|title=ইস্ট-ওয়েস্ট মেট্রো: বিধাননগরের সঙ্গে জুড়ে গেল ফুলবাগান|publisher=www.anandabazar.com|url=https://www.anandabazar.com/calcutta/east-west-metro-phoolbagan-metro-station-service-started-dgtl-1.1210983?ref=related-stry-4|access-date=8 October 2020|archive-date=29 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529191442/https://www.anandabazar.com/west-bengal/kolkata/east-west-metro-phoolbagan-metro-station-service-started-dgtl-1.1210983?ref=related-stry-4|url-status=live}}</ref> line from [[Salt Lake Sector-V Metro Station|Salt Lake Sector V]] to [[Phoolbagan metro station|Phoolbagan]], for a total of {{convert|38.26|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Four other lines are in various phases of construction. The system has a mix of underground, at-grade and elevated stations using both [[Broad-gauge railway|broad-gauge]] and [[Standard-gauge railway|standard-gauge]] tracks. Trains operate between 07:00 and 22:30 [[Indian Standard Time|IST]] and the fares range from ₹5 to ₹25 (US$0.066 to US$0.33).

The Kolkata Metro is the first planned and operational [[rapid transit|rapid transit system]] in India. It was initially planned in the 1920s, but construction started in the 1970s. The first underground stretch, from [[Bhowanipore|Bhawanipore]] (now [[Netaji Bhavan metro station|Netaji Bhawan]]) to [[Esplanade metro station|Esplanade]], opened in 1984. Line 2, or the East–West Corridor, opened in 2020. It is the fifth-longest operational metro network in India after the [[Delhi Metro]], [[Hyderabad Metro]], [[Namma Metro]] and [[Chennai Metro]].

[[Metro Railway, Kolkata]] and [[Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation]] are the owners and operator of the system. On 29 December 2010, Metro Railway, Kolkata, became the 17th zone of the [[Indian Railways]], completely owned and funded by the [[Ministry of Railways (India)|Ministry of Railways]]. It is the only metro in the country to be controlled by Indian Railways. There are around 300 daily train trips carrying more than {{Lakh|7}} passengers.

== History ==

=== Early attempts ===
In the September 1919 session of the Imperial Legislative Council at [[Shimla]], a committee was set up by [[Walter Ewing Crum|W. E. Crum]] that recommended a metro line for [[Kolkata]] (formerly [[Calcutta]]).<ref name=":15" /> This line was supposed to connect Bagmari in the east to Benaras Road, [[Salkia]], in Howrah in the west via a tunnel beneath [[Hooghly River]]. The estimated construction costs were £3,526,154, about {{INRConvert|36.4|c|lk=on|year=1921}} based on current exchange rates, and the proposed deadline was 1925–1926. The proposed line was {{convert|10.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, about {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} shorter than the current [[Kolkata Metro Line 2|East-West Corridor]], which would connect [[Eastern Bengal Railway|East Bengal Railway]] in Bagmari and [[East Indian Railway Company|East Indian Railway]] in Benaras Road. The tickets were priced at 3 annas ({{INR}} 0.1875) for the full trip. Crum also mentioned a north–south corridor back then. An east–west metro railway connection, named the "East–West Tube Railway", was proposed for Kolkata in 1921 by [[Harley Dalrymple-Hay]]. All the reports can be found in his 1921 book ''Calcutta Tube Railways.'' However, in 1923, the proposal was not undertaken due to a lack of funds.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ganguly|first=Deepankar|date=23 August 2014|title=Metro missed the train to Piccadilly|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/metro-missed-the-train-to-piccadilly/cid/1286509|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120820/https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/metro-missed-the-train-to-piccadilly/cid/1286509|archive-date=22 August 2020|access-date=10 May 2020|website=The Telegraph|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":15">{{Cite web|last=Jayanta Gupta|date=5 Feb 2020|title=Kolkata's Tube Railway plan nipped in bud a century ago|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/citys-tube-rly-plan-nipped-in-bud-a-century-ago/articleshow/73944018.cms|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208230956/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/citys-tube-rly-plan-nipped-in-bud-a-century-ago/articleshow/73944018.cms|archive-date=8 February 2020|access-date=11 February 2020|website=The Times of India|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Das|first=Madhuparna|date=2020-03-05|title=100 years in the making, why Kolkata's east-west corridor is world's slowest metro project|url=https://theprint.in/india/100-years-in-the-making-why-kolkatas-east-west-corridor-is-worlds-slowest-metro-project/369971/|access-date=2020-08-08|website=ThePrint|language=en-US|archive-date=30 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330122551/https://theprint.in/india/100-years-in-the-making-why-kolkatas-east-west-corridor-is-worlds-slowest-metro-project/369971/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Planning ===
The then [[Chief Minister of West Bengal]], [[Bidhan Chandra Roy]], reconceived the idea of an underground railway for Kolkata in the early 1949–1950. A survey was done by a team of [[France|French]] experts, but nothing concrete came of this. Efforts to solve problem traffic by augmenting the existing fleet of public transport vehicles hardly helped, since roads accounted for only 4.2&nbsp;percent of the surface area in Kolkata, compared with 25&nbsp;percent in [[Delhi]] and 30&nbsp;percent in other cities. To find alternative solutions, the Metropolitan Transport Project (MTP) was set up in 1969. The MTP, with the help of [[USSR|Soviet]] specialists, Lenmetroproekt and [[East Germany|East German]] engineers, prepared a master plan to provide five rapid-transit (metro) lines for the city of Kolkata, totaling a length of {{convert|97.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in 1971.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.kmrc.in/overview.php |title=Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation Ltd |publisher=Kmrc.in |access-date=27 January 2016 |archive-date=2 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602200841/http://www.kmrc.in/overview.php |url-status=live }}</ref> However, only three were selected for construction.

The highest priority was given to the busy north–south corridor between Dum Dum and Tollygunge over a length of {{convert|16.45|km|mi|abbr=on}}; work on this project was approved on 1 June 1972. A tentative deadline was fixed to complete all the corridors by 1991.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mukherjee|first=Devjyot Ghoshal & Sharmistha|date=3 November 2009|title=Delhi Metro speeds past Kolkata's|work=Business Standard India|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/delhi-metro-speeds-past-kolkata-s-109110300031_1.html|access-date=15 May 2020|archive-date=30 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195542/http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/delhi-metro-speeds-past-kolkata-s-109110300031_1.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since it was India's first metro<ref name=":20" /> and was constructed as a completely indigenous process, a traditional [[Tunnel#Cut-and-cover|cut-and-cover]] method and driven [[Tunnelling shield|shield tunneling]] was chosen and the Kolkata Metro was more of a trial-and-error affair, in contrast to the [[Delhi Metro]], which saw the involvement of multiple international consultants. As a result, it took nearly 23 years to completely construct the {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} underground railway.<ref name=":13" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=10 September 2007|title=Metro Railway, Kolkata|url=http://www.kolmetro.com/features/construc.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910194011/http://www.kolmetro.com/features/construc.html|archive-date=10 September 2007|access-date=30 May 2020|website=kolmetro.com}}</ref>

The foundation stone of the project was laid by [[Indira Gandhi]], the [[Prime Minister of India]], on 29 December 1972, and construction work started in 1973–74. Initially, [[Tunnel#Cut-and-cover|cut and cover]] along with [[slurry wall]] construction to handle soft ground, was recommended by the [[Soviet Union]] Consultants. Later, in 1977, it was decided to adopt both shield tunneling and cut and cover methods for construction under populated areas, sewer lines, water mains, electrical cables, telephone cables, tram lines, canals etc. The technology was provided by M/s NIKEX Hungarian Co., Budapest.<ref name=":19">{{Cite journal|last=Ghosal|first=Mainak|title=Challenges faced(then &amp; now)during Kolkata Metro Construction - A Study|url=https://www.academia.edu/37779455|journal=Structural Engineering Digest|language=en|access-date=15 July 2020|archive-date=22 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120754/https://www.academia.edu/37779455/Challenges_faced_then_and_now_during_Kolkata_Metro_Construction_A_Study|url-status=live}}</ref> In the early days, the project was led by the [[Minister of Railways (India)|Union Railway Minister]] from West Bengal, [[A. B. A. Ghani Khan Choudhury]], often against the prevailing socio-political stance of his contemporaries in the West Bengal government. From the start of construction, the project had to contend with several problems including insufficient funds (until 1977–1978), a shifting of underground utilities, court injunctions, and an irregular supply of vital materials.<ref name=":13" /><ref name=":7" /> In 1977, an injunction for the allocation of new funding was passed by the newly elected [[Jyoti Basu]] government.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Andrew |date=2006 |title=Reinventing Calcutta |journal=Asian Affairs |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=353–360 |doi=10.1080/03068370600906515 |s2cid=218620885 }}</ref>

Despite all the hurdles, services began on 24 October 1984, with the commissioning of a partial commercial service covering a distance of {{convert|3.40|km|mi|abbr=on}} with five stations served between Esplanade and [[Bhowanipore|Bhowanipur]] (currently [[Netaji Bhavan metro station|Netaji Bhavan]]).<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The first metro was driven by Tapan Kumar Nath and Sanjoy Kumar Sil.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Chakraborty|first=Ajanta|date=13 Feb 2020|title=West Bengal: Three drivers on roster to steer the first train|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/west-bengal-three-drivers-on-roster-to-steer-the-first-train/articleshow/74111444.cms|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-22|website=The Times of India|language=en}}</ref> The service was quickly followed by commuter services on another {{convert|2.15|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretch in the north between [[Dum Dum Metro Station|Dum Dum]] and [[Belgachhia Metro Station|Belgachhia]] on 12 November 1984. The commuter service was extended to [[Mahanayak Uttam Kumar metro station|Tollygunge]] on 29 April 1986, covering a further distance of {{convert|4.24|km|mi|abbr=on}}, making the service available over a distance of {{convert|9.79|km|mi|abbr=on}} and covering 11 stations.

[[Chief minister (India)|Chief Minister]] [[Mamata Banerjee]] proposed the politically controversial realignment of the East-West Corridor from [[Central metro station (Kolkata)|Central]] to Esplanade in 2012, stating that the original plan would affect 250 shop-owners and tenants in the [[Lalbazar]] and [[Bowbazar]] area. The residents and traders of those areas started protests. KMRC and [[Japan International Cooperation Agency|JICA]] requested the Government of West Bengal to stick to the original plan to avoid impacting the entire project. This was the first time in the country that a metro corridor alignment was being changed after preparation of [[Detailed Project Report|DPR]] and sanction of the project. Despite opposition from the official agencies, the Government of West Bengal forcefully approved the route realignment in 2013. This changed the location of [[Mahakaran metro station]] and increased the length of the corridor by {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Later, KMRC said that the realignment would increase ridership and revenue by at least 30 percent.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Maiti|first=Subhendu|date=10 September 2019|title=Questions over change of E-W Metro routes|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/bengal/questions-change-e-w-metro-routes-1502798453.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120755/https://www.thestatesman.com/bengal/questions-change-e-w-metro-routes-1502798453.html|archive-date=22 August 2020|access-date=19 May 2020|website=The Statesman|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite web|last=B|first=Krishnendu|date=18 April 2019|title=Systemic faults behind East-West Kolkata Metro delay, says expert|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/systemic-faults-behind-e-w-delay-says-expert/articleshow/68929581.cms|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120754/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/systemic-faults-behind-e-w-delay-says-expert/articleshow/68929581.cms|archive-date=22 August 2020|access-date=19 May 2020|website=The Times of India|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Das|first=Madhuparna|date=19 September 2019|title=Delhi said no but Mamata got Kolkata Metro to change route — now houses are collapsing|url=https://theprint.in/statedraft/mamata-govt-pushed-for-kolkata-east-west-metro-route-realignment-its-now-stuck-in-crisis/293729/|access-date=19 May 2020|website=ThePrint|language=en-US|archive-date=11 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211190654/https://theprint.in/statedraft/mamata-govt-pushed-for-kolkata-east-west-metro-route-realignment-its-now-stuck-in-crisis/293729/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The realignment led to many other issues and delays. Some of the biggest issues were the H-piles under Esplanade metro station and the Bowbazar mishap. As per the 1971 master plan, the East-West Corridor was supposed to pass under Central metro station, so the square foundational beams in Esplanade were not removed. Since the [[Tunnel boring machine|Tunnel Boring Machines]] (TBMs) cannot cut through steel, another small tunnel was dug using [[New Austrian tunnelling method|New Austrian tunnelling method (NATM)]] and the H-piles were cut manually. This extended the tunneling process by one and a half months.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Chakraborty|first=Ajanta|date=14 April 2018|title=Kolkata metro: Kolkata: Metro tunnel boring hits steel wall at Esplanade|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-metro-tunnel-boring-hits-steel-wall-at-esplanade/articleshow/63755829.cms|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120806/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-metro-tunnel-boring-hits-steel-wall-at-esplanade/articleshow/63755829.cms|archive-date=22 August 2020|access-date=3 June 2020|website=The Times of India|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Jayanta Gupta|date=2 August 2018|title=Kolkata metro: 'Microsurgery' at Esplanade to remove E-W Metro hurdle|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/microsurgery-at-esplanade-to-remove-e-w-metro-hurdle/articleshow/65237109.cms|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200707160420/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/microsurgery-at-esplanade-to-remove-e-w-metro-hurdle/articleshow/65237109.cms|archive-date=7 July 2020|access-date=3 June 2020|website=The Times of India|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Shukla|first=Darshana|date=6 August 2018|title=Kolkata Metro {{!}} KMRCL plans microsurgery to solve E-W metro hurdle|url=https://www.metrorailnews.in/kolkata-metro-kmrcl-plans-microsurgery-solve-e-w-metro-hurdle/|access-date=3 June 2020|website=Metro Rail News|language=en-US|archive-date=3 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603185509/https://www.metrorailnews.in/kolkata-metro-kmrcl-plans-microsurgery-solve-e-w-metro-hurdle/|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2019, during the construction of the eastbound tunnel (from Esplanade to [[Sealdah metro station|Sealdah]]), a TBM hit an [[aquifer]] under Bowbazar, causing a major collapse in the area, delaying work in that section for several months.

=== Expansion planning ===
By 2011–2012, the [[Ministry of Railways (India)|Railway Ministry]] had announced plans for the construction of five new metro lines and an extension of the existing north–south corridor. These were:<ref name=":6" /><ref name="toi" />

# [[Salt Lake City, Kolkata|Salt Lake]] – [[Howrah Maidan metro station|Howrah Maidan]] ([[Kolkata Metro Line 2|Line 2]] or East–West Metro Corridor)
# [[Joka, Kolkata|Joka]] – [[B.B.D. Bagh]] ([[Kolkata Metro Line 3|Line 3]]. Later truncated till Esplanade)
# Noapara–[[Barasat]] ([[Kolkata Metro Line 4|Line 4]], via airport)
# [[Baranagar]]–[[Barrackpore]] ([[Kolkata Metro Line 5|Line 5]])
# New Garia – [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport|Dum Dum Airport]] ([[Kolkata Metro Line 6|Line 6]])

==== Major modifications ====
A new four-platform [[interchange station]] was constructed at Noapara. This will act as an interchange station between Line 1 and [[Kolkata Metro Line 4|Line 4]]. For the time being, only two platforms are in use, but once Line 4 is running, all four platforms will be operational.<ref name=":9"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Kolkata Metro Commissioned 3rd Platform At Noapara on Friday|url=https://english.kolkata24x7.com/kolkata-metro-commissioned-3rd-platform-noapara.html/|date=21 January 2017|website=Kolkata24x7: Latest English and Bengali News, Bangla News, Breaking News, Business, Tollywood, Cricket|language=en-US|access-date=20 May 2020|archive-date=22 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120823/https://english.kolkata24x7.com/kolkata-metro-commissioned-3rd-platform-noapara.html/|url-status=live}}</ref> The existing Esplanade metro station is being upgraded and a subway is being constructed to the new metro station to provide an interchange among Line 1, [[Kolkata Metro Line 2|Line 2]] and [[Kolkata Metro Line 3|Line 3]].<ref name=":17">{{Cite web|last=Chakraborty|first=Ajanta|date=13 August 2019|title=India's deepest Metro station comes up 30m below Howrah railway station|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/a-stn-comes-up-30m-below-howrah-stn/articleshow/70650925.cms|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902231046/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/a-stn-comes-up-30m-below-howrah-stn/articleshow/70650925.cms|archive-date=2 September 2019|access-date=20 May 2020|website=The Times of India|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Sanjay Mandal|date=2 January 2020|title=East West Metro design in last leg|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/east-west-metro-design-in-last-leg/cid/1732558|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120824/https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/east-west-metro-design-in-last-leg/cid/1732558|archive-date=22 August 2020|access-date=29 July 2020|website=The Telegraph}}</ref> In 2009–2010, Line 1 underwent upgrades of services and amenities and many stations were renamed after famous personalities by then Minister of Railways Mamata Banerjee.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Game of the name|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/game-of-the-name/cid/1266496|date=26 July 2009|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409172336/https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/game-of-the-name/cid/1266496|archive-date=9 April 2019|access-date=20 May 2020}}</ref>

Line 1, or the Blue line, has a total length of {{convert|31.3|km|mi}} serving 26 [[List of Kolkata metro stations|stations]], of which 15 are underground, 9 are elevated and 2 at-grade. It uses the {{Track gauge|5ft6in|lk=on}} [[broad gauge]] tracks. It was the first underground railway to be built in India, with the first trains running in October 1984 and the full stretch that had been initially planned completed and operational by February 1995. The southward extension of Blue line to an elevated corridor from [[Mahanayak Uttam Kumar metro station|Tollygunge]] to [[Kavi Subhash Metro Station|New Garia]] was constructed and opened in two phases, [[Mahanayak Uttam Kumar metro station|Mahanayak Uttam Kumar]] to [[Kavi Nazrul Metro Station|Kavi Nazrul]] in 2009 and Kavi Nazrul to [[Kavi Subhash Metro Station|Kavi Subhash]] in 2010.

Green Line or Line 2, is the second metro corridor to connect Kolkata with [[Howrah]] by an underwater metro line below the [[Hooghly River]]. The length was supposed to be {{convert|14.67|km|mi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|8.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} underground and {{convert|5.77|km|mi|abbr=on}} elevated. However, the project was stalled several times due to land acquisition and slum relocation issues. A major route realignment in 2013 increased the length to {{convert|16.55|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The elevated stretch is {{convert|5.77|km|mi|abbr=on}} long while the underground stretch is {{convert|10.81|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The [[Mominpur metro station]] was planned to build across a 2500 sq. m area. However, the Ministry of Defence objected to the elevated structure, saying that it would overlook the Ordnance depot. This forced RVNL to stall the entire project, and RVNL almost dropped the station from the plan even though it alone would have a projected 20,000 passengers during peak hours. Underground Mominpur station was also not possible due to the sharp gradient from [[Taratala metro station]].<ref name=":23" /> After a series of discussions and consultations with the Ministry of Defence and Government of West Bengal in 2016, it was decided to shift the station around {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} northward, near the Alipore Bodyguard Lines.<ref name=":24">{{Cite web|last=Byandhopadhyay|first=Krishnendu|date=17 April 2016|title=Kolkata's Mominpore station jinx broken, Joka-BBD Bag Metro rises again|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Kolkatas-Mominpore-station-jinx-broken-Joka-BBD-Bag-Metro-rises-again/articleshow/51861284.cms|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131020447/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Kolkatas-Mominpore-station-jinx-broken-Joka-BBD-Bag-Metro-rises-again/articleshow/51861284.cms|archive-date=31 January 2017|access-date=18 May 2020|website=The Times of India|language=en}}</ref> But, after a year Defence Ministry approved the Mominpur metro station in its original location as the change in alignment would have delayed the project and budget overrun.

The Pink Line is the northward extension from Baranagar to Barrackpore [{{convert|12.45|km|mi|abbr=on}}]. It was sanctioned at a cost of {{INRConvert|2069.6|c|lk=on|year=2010}} in the 2010–2011 budget. This line was meant to enable a quick commute from the northernmost suburbs to [[South Kolkata]]. The work corridor is being executed by RVNL. As of May 2021, no physical construction has commenced, and the project has been stalled as metro construction would affect the water pipelines along [[Barrackpore Trunk Road]].<ref name="Going going...

== Owners and operators ==
Since the formation of the Metropolitan Transport Project (MTP) in 1969, Kolkata Metro has always been under the [[Indian Railways]], directly or indirectly. It is the only metro in the country to be controlled by Indian Railways. On 29 December 2010, Metro Railway, Kolkata, became the 17th zone of the Indian Railways, completely owned and funded by the [[Ministry of Railways (India)|Ministry of Railways]]. Although [[Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation]] was formed with 50-50 shares of the Government of West Bengal and the Government of India, as the implementing agency of the East–West Corridor, later majority shares were transferred to Indian Railways. In July 2019, the operation of Green line was handed over to Metro Railway, Kolkata.<ref name=":10" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Sanjay Mandal|date=18 July 2019|title=East-West load on struggling Metro|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/east-west-load-on-struggling-metro/cid/1694759|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723154800/https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/east-west-load-on-struggling-metro/cid/1694759|archive-date=23 July 2019|access-date=20 May 2020|website=The Telegraph|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=29 December 2010|title=Kolkata Metro is now the 17th zone of Indian Railways|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-29/india/28264643_1_metro-railway-kolkata-metro-foundation-stone|access-date=29 December 2010|archive-date=4 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104080043/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-29/india/28264643_1_metro-railway-kolkata-metro-foundation-stone|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Seat reservation ===
In 2008, the Kolkata Metro Railway experimented with the practice of reserving two entire compartments for women. This system was found to be ineffective and caused inconvenience for a lot of commuters (including women) and the plan was dropped.<ref name=":11">{{cite web|title=Existing Features|url=http://www.mtp.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,375,376|date=15 January 2020|website=www.mtp.indianrailways.gov.in|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806123154/http://www.mtp.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,375,376|archive-date=6 August 2013|access-date=30 June 2013}}</ref>

Now, certain sections of seats in each compartment are reserved for women, senior citizens and the physically challenged.

=== Stations and electrification ===
Kolkata Metro has 33 stations, of which 16 are underground, 15 are elevated and 2 are at grade. Currently, [[Noapara Metro Station|Noapara]] is the largest metro station in the system and it will be the interchange station for Blue line and Yellow line. The under-construction Howrah metro station is the deepest metro station in India.<ref name=":17" /> The standard length of platforms in Kolkata Metro is 170 m. The metro stations of [[Gitanjali Metro Station|Gitanjali]] and [[Netaji Metro Station|Netaji]] have the shortest platforms of 163 m.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mandal|first=Sanjay|date=26 May 2010|title=Metro overshoots safety line - Platforms at two stations shorter than stipulated|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/metro-overshoots-safety-line-platforms-at-two-stations-shorter-than-stipulated/cid/1181235|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120938/https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/metro-overshoots-safety-line-platforms-at-two-stations-shorter-than-stipulated/cid/1181235|archive-date=22 August 2020|access-date=30 June 2013|website=The Telegraph}}</ref> The average length between any two stations is {{convert|1.14|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The shortest distance is {{convert|0.597|km|mi|abbr=on}} between Central and [[Chandni Chowk Metro Station, Kolkata|Chandni Chowk]], and the longest distance is {{convert|2.15|km|mi|abbr=on}} between Dum Dum and [[Belgachhia Metro Station|Belgachia]]. Since the Kolkata Metro has 750 V DC [[third rail]] electrification, electricity substations were built in [[Jatin Das Park Metro Station|Jatin Das Park]], Central and [[Shyambazaar Metro Station|Shyambazar]]. The tracks are ballastless with M1A track fittings.<ref name=":11" />

=== Signalling and telecommunication ===
[[File:Kolkata Metro CRRC Dalian rake 3.jpg|thumb|[[Girish Park metro station]]|alt=]]Trains operate on typical Indian Railways automatic signalling technology. A Route Relay Interlocking System has been provided at [[New Garia depot]] and [[Tollygunge depot]] and Electronic Interlocking has been provided at [[Noapara metro station and depot|Noapara depot]] to facilitate the prompt withdrawal and injection of rakes and to perform shunting operations inside the car shed for maintenance purposes. The [[Train Protection & Warning System|Train Protection and Warning System]] (TPWS) is provided throughout the Metro Railway. It is designed to prevent collisions caused by human (operator) error.<ref>{{cite web|date=3 March 2013|title=Automatic warning to make Metro safer|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-03/kolkata/37409504_1_ac-rakes-conventional-rakes-konkan-railway|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116115057/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-03/kolkata/37409504_1_ac-rakes-conventional-rakes-konkan-railway|archive-date=16 January 2014|website=[[The Times of India]]|access-date=30 June 2013}}</ref> A Train Describer System and Auto Train Charting are used to help the operation control centre monitor and plan train movement on a real-time basis.

An upgrade of the existing signalling system of the [[Kolkata Metro Line 2|North-South]] corridor from Indian Railways Signalling to Communication Based Train Control was planned by Metro Railway, Kolkata, at {{INRConvert|467|c|lk=on|year=2020}} and the proposal was sent to Indian Railways, so that time interval between trains can be decreased to just 90 seconds from 5 minutes. In August 2019, Indian Railways gave a go-ahead to the proposal, and installation work is supposed to be complete within 2–3 years.<ref name=":5" />

Unlike the previous line, the Green line adopted the more advanced Communications Based Train Control system. It has [[cab signalling]] and a centralised [[automatic train control]] system consisting of [[Automatic train operation|automatic operation]], [[Automatic train protection|protection]]  and signalling modules. The signalling system is provided by Italy-based company [[Ansaldo STS]]. The other signalling equipment includes an integrated system with fibre optic cable, SCADA, radios, and a public-address system.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kolkata Metro East-West Corridor|url=https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/kolkatametro/|website=Railway Technology|language=en-GB|access-date=18 May 2020|archive-date=21 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200521020500/https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/kolkatametro/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Kolkata East West Metro gets safety clearance for signalling systems|url=https://www.urbantransportnews.com/kolkata-east-west-metro-gets-safety-clearance-for-signalling-systems/|last=Batra|first=Mannat|date=12 July 2019|website=Urban Transport News|language=en-US|access-date=18 May 2020|archive-date=7 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307144619/https://www.urbantransportnews.com/kolkata-east-west-metro-gets-safety-clearance-for-signalling-systems/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Mandal|first=Sanjay|date=29 July 2020|title=Smart signalling for swifter East-West|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/smart-signalling-for-swifter-east-west/cid/1403493|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120842/https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/smart-signalling-for-swifter-east-west/cid/1403493|archive-date=22 August 2020|access-date=18 May 2020|website=The Telegraph|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.|url=http://www.kmrc.in/highlight.php|website=www.kmrc.in|access-date=24 May 2020|archive-date=25 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200125025126/http://www.kmrc.in/highlight.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Public address system ===
PA systems are present at all stations and their premises. A station master can make a necessary announcement to the passengers and staff, overriding the ongoing local announcement. Train PA systems are controlled by the motormen for announcements to passengers on the particular train.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Public Address System (PA System)|url=https://mtp.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,394,410|date=8 May 2014|website=mtp.indianrailways.gov.in|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217144414/http://mtp.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,394,410|archive-date=17 February 2019|access-date=20 May 2020}}</ref>

== Issues ==
Since Kolkata Metro was constructed in the 1970s, there were some technical limitations. Due to the tunnel dimensions, and being under Indian Railways, Kolkata Metro opted for Indian [[Metre-gauge railway|metre gauge]] shell (2.7 m width) mounted upon {{TrackGauge|1676mm}} [[Broad-gauge railway|broad gauge]] bogies. The rakes have to be custom built and require a special assembly line involving additional costs thus limiting the options for rake manufacturers for [[Kolkata Metro Line 1|Blue line]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jayanta Gupta|date=23 August 2019|title=Kolkata Metro will continue to have problems with rakes, thanks to its construction|work=The Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/metro-will-continue-to-have-problems-with-rakes-thanks-to-its-construction/articleshow/70795410.cms|url-status=live|access-date=30 July 2020|archive-date=27 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127210954/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/metro-will-continue-to-have-problems-with-rakes-thanks-to-its-construction/articleshow/70795410.cms}}</ref> From its inception, the coaches were manufactured by [[Integral Coach Factory|ICF]], which lacked the pre-requisite knowledge for manufactured non-air-conditioning rakes. The 3000 and 4000 series rakes were faulty and delivered without any trials. In addition, Indian Railways signalling is used instead of European signalling. All of these factors have led to snags, delays and accidents.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kolkata Metro tragedy: 'Medha' rakes withdrawn from operation|url=https://www.sirfnews.com/kolkata-metro-tragedy-medha-rakes-withdrawn-from-operation/|date=15 July 2019|website=Sirf News|language=en-GB|access-date=19 May 2020|archive-date=22 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120844/https://sirfnews.com/kolkata-metro-tragedy-medha-rakes-withdrawn-from-operation/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Gupta|first=Jayanta|date=12 June 2019|title=After Monday's disruption, Kolkata Metro back to old rakes; services dip|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-mondays-disruption-metro-back-to-old-rakes-services-dip/articleshow/69747423.cms|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613055414/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-mondays-disruption-metro-back-to-old-rakes-services-dip/articleshow/69747423.cms|archive-date=13 June 2019|access-date=19 May 2020|website=The Times of India|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Mitra|first=Debraj|date=13 July 2019|title=New trains with a history of snags|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/new-calcutta-metro-trains-with-a-history-of-snags/cid/1694454|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822120920/https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/new-calcutta-metro-trains-with-a-history-of-snags/cid/1694454|archive-date=22 August 2020|access-date=19 May 2020|website=The Telegraph|language=en}}</ref>

Unlike Delhi Metro, Kolkata Metro is owned and operated by Indian Railways instead of an autonomous body, and it relies solely on Indian Railways for every decision, from funding to route realignment.<ref name=":8" /> The founder of Delhi Metro, [[E. Sreedharan]], said Indian Railways are not experts at urban transport and misplanned the Kolkata Metro from the beginning, and he felt that a private company should run the metro and could bring it up to standard in five years.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=Alokesh|last2=J|first2=Anand|date=9 January 2012|title=DMRC MD E Sreedharan says many Indian cities need metro rail urgently|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/interviews/e-sreedharan-delhi-metro-interview/story/21128.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110195448/http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/interviews/e-sreedharan-delhi-metro-interview/story/21128.html|archive-date=10 November 2017|access-date=19 May 2020|website=www.businesstoday.in}}</ref>
