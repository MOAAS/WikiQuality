This list of most-liked YouTube videos contains the top 30 videos with the most likes of all time, taken directly from the video page. YouTube implemented a like and dislike button on these pages in March 2010, part of a major redesign of the site. This served as a replacement for their five-star rating system; YouTube's designers found the previous system ineffective because the options to rate a video between two and four stars were rarely selected.

The music video for LMFAO's song "Party Rock Anthem" stood as the most-liked video on YouTube in 2012, with 1.56 million likes, until the video for Psy's "Gangnam Style" surpassed it in September that year with more than 1.57 million likes. Following this accomplishment, "Gangnam Style" entered the Guinness World Records book as the most-liked video on YouTube and on the Internet as of 2012. Psy's video remained the most-liked on YouTube for nearly four years until August 27, 2016, when Wiz Khalifa's "See You Again" featuring Charlie Puth surpassed it with 11.21 million likes. Less than a year later, on July 25, 2017, Luis Fonsi's "Despacito" featuring Daddy Yankee claimed the top spot with 16.01 million likes.
