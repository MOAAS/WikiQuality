Archimedes died during the [[Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)|siege of Syracuse]], when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. [[Cicero]] describes visiting Archimedes' tomb, which was surmounted by a [[sphere]] and a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], which Archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries.

Unlike his inventions, Archimedes' mathematical writings were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from [[Alexandria]] read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until {{circa|530{{nbsp}}AD}} by [[Isidore of Miletus]] in [[Byzantine]] [[Constantinople]], while commentaries on the works of Archimedes by [[Eutocius of Ascalon|Eutocius]] in the 6th century opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the [[Middle Ages]] were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the [[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance]] and again [[Scientific Revolution|in the 17th century]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hoyrup|first=J.|title=Archimedes: Knowledge and lore from Latin Antiquity to the outgoing European Renaissance|year=2019|location=Selected Essays on Pre- and Early Modern Mathematical Practice|pages=459–477}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leahy|first=A.|date=2018|title=The method of Archimedes in the seventeenth century.|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00029890.2018.1413857|journal=The American Monthly|volume=125|issue=3|pages=267–272|doi=10.1080/00029890.2018.1413857|s2cid=125559661|access-date=20 March 2021|archive-date=14 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714040624/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029890.2018.1413857|url-status=live}}</ref> while the discovery in 1906 of previously lost works by Archimedes in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.<ref>{{cite web |title=Works, Archimedes |date=23 June 2015 |publisher=University of Oklahoma |url=https://galileo.ou.edu/exhibits/works-archimedes |access-date=18 June 2019 |archive-date=15 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815081118/https://galileo.ou.edu/exhibits/works-archimedes |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Genius of Archimedes – 23 Centuries of Influence on Mathematics, Science and Engineering: Proceedings of an International Conference held at Syracuse, Italy|date= 8–10 June 2010|series=History of Mechanism and Machine Science|volume=11|publisher=Springer|editor1=Paipetis, Stephanos A.|editor2=Ceccarelli, Marco|isbn=978-90-481-9091-1|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-9091-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Archimedes&nbsp;– The Palimpsest |publisher=[[Walters Art Museum]] |url=http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/palimpsest_making1.html |access-date=14 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928102802/http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/palimpsest_making1.html |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/26/archimedes-palimpsest-ahead-of-time|title=Archimedes Palimpsest reveals insights centuries ahead of its time|newspaper=The Guardian|first1=Alison|last1=Flood|access-date=10 February 2017|archive-date=15 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515154701/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/26/archimedes-palimpsest-ahead-of-time|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Biography==

Archimedes was born c. 287 BC in the seaport city of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]], at that time a self-governing colony in [[Magna Graecia]]. The date of birth is based on a statement by the Byzantine Greek historian [[John Tzetzes]] that Archimedes lived for 75 years before his death in 212 BC.<ref name=":0" /> In the ''[[The Sand Reckoner|Sand-Reckoner]]'', Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an astronomer about whom nothing else is known.<ref name=":3" /> A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides, but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children, or if he ever visited [[Alexandria]], Egypt, during his youth.<ref name=":4" /> From his surviving written works, it is clear that he maintained collegiate relations with scholars based there, including his friend [[Conon of Samos]] and the head librarian [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]].<ref group="lower-alpha">In the preface to ''On Spirals'' addressed to Dositheus of Pelusium, Archimedes says that "many years have elapsed since Conon's death." [[Conon of Samos]] lived c. 280–220 BC, suggesting that Archimedes may have been an older man when writing some of his works.</ref>

The standard versions of Archimedes' life were written long after his death by Greek and Roman historians. The earliest reference to Archimedes occurs in ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'' by [[Polybius]] ({{circa}} 200–118 BC), written about 70 years after his death. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city from the Romans.<ref name="death">{{cite web|last=Rorres|first=Chris|title=Death of Archimedes: Sources|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Death/Histories.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210060235/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Death/Histories.html|archive-date=10 December 2006|access-date=2 January 2007|publisher=[[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]]}}</ref> Polybius remarks how, during the [[Second Punic War]], Syracuse switched allegiances from [[Roman Republic|Rome]] to [[Carthage]], resulting in a military campaign to take the city under the command of [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] and [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 212 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]], which lasted from 213 to 212 BC. He notes that the Romans underestimated Syracuse's defenses, and mentions several machines Archimedes designed, including improved catapults, cranelike machines that could be swung around in an arc, and stone-throwers. Although the Romans ultimately captured the city, they suffered considerable losses due to Archimedes' inventiveness.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rorres|first=Chris|title=Siege of Syracuse|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Siege/Polybius.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609013114/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Siege/Polybius.html|archive-date=9 June 2007|access-date=23 July 2007|publisher=Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences}}</ref>

[[File:Cicero Discovering the Tomb of Archimedes by Benjamin West.jpeg|thumb|right|''[[Cicero]] Discovering the Tomb of Archimedes'' (1805) by [[Benjamin West]]]]
[[Cicero]] (106–43 BC) mentions Archimedes in some of his works. While serving as a [[quaestor]] in Sicily, Cicero found what was presumed to be Archimedes' tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. The tomb carried a sculpture illustrating Archimedes' [[On the Sphere and Cylinder|favorite mathematical proof]], that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two-thirds that of the cylinder including its bases.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rorres|first=Chris|title=Tomb of Archimedes: Sources|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209201723/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|archive-date=9 December 2006|access-date=2 January 2007|publisher=Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rorres|first=Chris|title=Tomb of Archimedes&nbsp;– Illustrations|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/TombIllus.html|access-date=15 March 2011|publisher=Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|archive-date=2 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502194615/https://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/TombIllus.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He also mentions that Marcellus brought to Rome two planetariums Archimedes built.<ref name=":5" /> The Roman historian [[Livy]] (59 BC–17 AD) retells Polybius' story of the capture of Syracuse and Archimedes' role in it.<ref name="death" />

[[Plutarch]] (45–119 AD) wrote in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' that Archimedes was related to King [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], the ruler of Syracuse.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Plutarch]]|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/674|title=''Parallel Lives'' Complete e-text from Gutenberg.org|date=October 1996|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]|access-date=23 July 2007|archive-date=20 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920124059/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/674|url-status=live}}</ref> He also provides at least two accounts on how Archimedes died after the city was taken. According to the most popular account, Archimedes was contemplating a mathematical diagram when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet Marcellus, but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. This enraged the soldier, who killed Archimedes with his sword. Another story has Archimedes carrying mathematical instruments before being killed because a soldier thought they were valuable items. Marcellus was reportedly angered by Archimedes' death, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset (he called Archimedes "a geometrical [[Hecatoncheires|Briareus]]") and had ordered that he should not be harmed.<ref name=":6" /><ref>Jaeger, Mary. ''Archimedes and the Roman Imagination''. p. 113.</ref>

The last words attributed to Archimedes are "Do not disturb my circles" ([[Latin]], "''Noli turbare circulos meos''"; [[Katharevousa|Katharevousa Greek]], "μὴ μου τοὺς κύκλους τάραττε"), a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier. There is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in Plutarch's account. A similar quotation is found in the work of [[Valerius Maximus]] (fl. 30 AD), who wrote in ''Memorable Doings and Sayings'', "{{Lang-la|... sed protecto manibus puluere 'noli' inquit, 'obsecro, istum disturbare'|label=none}}" ("... but protecting the dust with his hands, said 'I beg of you, do not disturb this{{'"}}).<ref name="death" />

==Discoveries and inventions==

===Archimedes' principle===
{{main|Archimedes' principle}}
[[File:03. Реакциска сила кај архимедовиот закон.ogv|thumb|right|250px|A metal bar, placed into a container of water on a scale, displaces as much water as its own [[volume]], increasing the [[mass]] of the container's contents and weighing down the scale.]]
The most widely known anecdote about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to [[Vitruvius]], a [[votive crown]] for a temple had been made for [[Hiero II of Syracuse|King Hiero II of Syracuse]], who had supplied the pure gold to be used; Archimedes was asked to determine whether some silver had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith.<ref name="vitruvius">{{cite book|title = ''De Architectura'', Book IX, paragraphs 9–12|author = [[Vitruvius]]|publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]|url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/20239-h.htm|access-date = 26 December 2018|date = 31 December 2006|archive-date = 6 November 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191106054452/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/20239-h.htm|url-status = live}}</ref> Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its [[density]].

In Vitruvius' account, Archimedes noticed while taking a bath that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the crown's [[volume]]. For practical purposes water is incompressible,<ref>{{cite web|title = Incompressibility of Water|publisher =[[Harvard University]]|url = http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/IncompressibilityofWater/IncompressibilityofWater.html|access-date=27 February 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080317130651/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/IncompressibilityofWater/IncompressibilityofWater.html| archive-date= 17 March 2008| url-status= live}}</ref> so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!" ({{lang-el|"εὕρηκα}}, ''heúrēka''!, {{Literal translation|I have found [it]!}}).<ref name="vitruvius" /> The test on the crown was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.<ref>{{cite web |editor-last=Rorres |editor-first=Chris |title=The Golden Crown: Sources |publisher=[[New York University]] |url=https://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/Vitruvius.html |access-date=6 April 2021 |archive-date=9 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309151633/https://math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/Vitruvius.html |url-status=live }}

The story of the golden crown does not appear anywhere in Archimedes' known works.

===Archimedes' screw===
{{main|Archimedes' screw}}
[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|The [[Archimedes' screw]] can raise water efficiently.]]

A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering probably arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. The Greek writer [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the ''[[Syracusia]]'', which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a [[naval warship]]. The ''Syracusia'' is said to have been the largest ship built in [[classical antiquity]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Casson|first=Lionel|author-link=Lionel Casson|title=Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World|year=1971|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-03536-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shipsseamanshipi0000cass}}</ref> According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and a temple dedicated to the goddess [[Aphrodite]] among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, [[Archimedes' screw]] was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a {{nowrap|low-lying}} body of water into irrigation canals. Archimedes' screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. Described in Roman times by Vitruvius, Archimedes' screw may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=''Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World''|author=[[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]]|author2=[[John Peter Oleson|Oleson, John Peter]]|publisher=Technology and Culture Volume 44, Number 1, January 2003 (PDF)|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/toc/tech44.1.html|access-date=23 July 2007|archive-date=20 June 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HWnVCG3J?url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/toc/tech44.1.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Archimedes' screw&nbsp;– Optimal Design|author=Rorres, Chris|publisher=Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|url=http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Screw/optimal/optimal.html|access-date=23 July 2007|archive-date=20 June 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HWnVsSZb?url=https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Screw/optimal/optimal.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The world's first seagoing [[steamboat|steamship]] with a [[propeller|screw propeller]] was the [[SS Archimedes|SS ''Archimedes'']], which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.<ref>{{cite web|title = SS Archimedes|publisher = wrecksite.eu|url = http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?636|access-date = 22 January 2011|archive-date = 2 October 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111002100032/http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?636|url-status = live}}</ref>

===Claw of Archimedes===
The [[Claw of Archimedes]] is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as "the ship shaker", the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal [[grappling hook]] was suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled ''Superweapons of the Ancient World'' built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.<ref>{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Rorres|title=Archimedes' Claw&nbsp;– Illustrations and Animations&nbsp;– a range of possible designs for the claw|publisher=Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Claw/illustrations.html|access-date=23 July 2007|archive-date=7 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207030305/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Claw/illustrations.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Archimedes' Claw&nbsp;– watch an animation|first=Bradley W |last=Carroll|publisher = Weber State University| url = http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/claw.htm|access-date=12 August 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813202716/http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/claw.htm| archive-date= 13 August 2007| url-status= live}}</ref>

===Heat ray===
[[File:Archimedes Heat Ray conceptual diagram.svg|thumb|right|Archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a [[parabolic reflector]] to burn ships attacking [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].]]

Archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a [[parabolic reflector]] to burn ships attacking Syracuse. The 2nd-century author [[Lucian]] wrote that during the [[Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] (c. 214–212 BC), Archimedes destroyed enemy ships with fire. Centuries later, [[Anthemius of Tralles]] mentions [[burning-glass]]es as Archimedes' weapon.<ref>''Hippias'', 2 (cf. [[Galen]], ''On temperaments'' 3.2, who mentions ''pyreia'', "torches"); [[Anthemius of Tralles]], ''On miraculous engines'' 153 [Westerman].</ref> The device, sometimes called the "Archimedes heat ray", was used to focus sunlight onto approaching ships, causing them to catch fire. In the modern era, similar devices have been constructed and may be referred to as a [[heliostat]] or [[solar furnace]].<ref>{{cite web| title = World's Largest Solar Furnace| work = Atlas Obscura| url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-largest-solar-furnace| access-date = 6 November 2016| archive-date = 5 November 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161105223651/http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-largest-solar-furnace| url-status = live}}</ref>

This purported weapon has been the subject of an ongoing debate about its credibility since the [[Renaissance]]. [[René Descartes]] rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[John Wesley]] |url = http://wesley.nnu.edu/john_wesley/wesley_natural_philosophy/duten12.htm| title = ''A Compendium of Natural Philosophy'' (1810) Chapter XII, ''Burning Glasses''|publisher = Online text at Wesley Center for Applied Theology|access-date = 14 September 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012154432/http://wesley.nnu.edu/john_wesley/wesley_natural_philosophy/duten12.htm |archive-date = 12 October 2007}}</ref> It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished [[bronze]] or [[copper]] shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship.

Cicero mentions Archimedes briefly in his [[dialogue]] ''[[De re publica]]'', which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129 BC. After the capture of Syracuse c. 212 BC, General [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, that showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] to [[Lucius Furius Philus]], who described it thus:<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Cicero]]|title=''De re publica'' 1.xiv §21|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/repub1.shtml#21|access-date=23 July 2007|publisher=thelatinlibrary.com|archive-date=22 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322054142/http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/repub1.shtml#21|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=[[Cicero]]|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988|title=''De re publica'' Complete e-text in English from Gutenberg.org|date=9 February 2005|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]|access-date=18 September 2007|archive-date=20 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920133735/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Mathematics==
While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of [[Greek mathematics|mathematics]]. [[Plutarch]] wrote that Archimedes "placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life",<ref name=":6">{{cite book| title = Extract from ''Parallel Lives''| author = [[Plutarch]]| publisher = fulltextarchive.com| url = https://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Plutarch-s-Lives10/#p35| access-date = 10 August 2009| archive-date = 7 March 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140307092350/http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Plutarch-s-Lives10/#p35| url-status = live}}</ref> though some scholars believe this may be a mischaracterization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Russo|first=L.|date=2013|title=Archimedes between legend and fact.|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40329-013-0016-y.pdf|journal=Lettera Matematica|volume=1|issue=3|pages=91–95|doi=10.1007/s40329-013-0016-y|s2cid=161786723|quote="It is amazing that for a long time Archimedes' attitude towards the applications of science was deduced from the acritical acceptance of the opinion of Plutarch: a polygraph who lived centuries later, in a cultural climate that was completely different, certainly could not have known the intimate thoughts of the scientist.

=== Method of exhaustion ===
[[File:PiArchimede4.svg|thumb|right|Archimedes calculates the side of the 12-gon from that of the [[hexagon]] and for each subsequent doubling of the sides of the regular polygon.]]
Archimedes was able to use [[Cavalieri's principle|indivisibles]] (a precursor to [[infinitesimal]]s) in a way that is similar to modern [[Integral|integral calculus]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Powers|first=J|date=2020|title=Did Archimedes do calculus?|url=https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/46/HOMSIGMAA/2020-Jeffery%20Powers.pdf|archive-format=|access-date=2021-04-14|website=www.maa.org|archive-date=31 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731151913/https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/46/HOMSIGMAA/2020-Jeffery%20Powers.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Through proof by contradiction (''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the [[method of exhaustion]], and he employed it to approximate the areas of figures and the value of [[Pi|π]].

In ''[[Measurement of a Circle]]'', he did this by drawing a larger [[regular hexagon]] outside a [[circle]] then a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each [[regular polygon]], calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of π lay between 3{{sfrac|1|7}} (approx. 3.1429) and 3{{sfrac|10|71}} (approx. 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416.<ref>{{cite web| title =Archimedes on measuring the circle| author =Heath, T.L.| publisher =math.ubc.ca| url =http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/archimedes/circle.html| access-date =30 October 2012| archive-date =3 July 2004| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20040703122928/http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/archimedes/circle.html| url-status =live}}</ref> He also proved that the [[area of a circle]] was equal to π multiplied by the [[square]] of the [[radius]] of the circle (<math display="inline">\pi r^2</math>). 

==== Archimedean property ====
In ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder]]'', Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. Today this is known as the [[Archimedean property]] of real numbers.<ref>{{cite web| title = Archimedean ordered fields| author = Kaye, R.W.| publisher = web.mat.bham.ac.uk| url = http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/seqser/archfields| access-date = 7 November 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090316065753/http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/seqser/archfields| archive-date = 16 March 2009| url-status = dead}}</ref>

Archimedes gives the value of the [[square root]] of 3 as lying between {{sfrac|265|153}} (approximately 1.7320261) and {{sfrac|1351|780}} (approximately 1.7320512) in ''Measurement of a Circle''. The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused [[John Wallis]] to remark that he was: "as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results."<ref>Quoted in Heath, T.L. ''Works of Archimedes'', Dover Publications, {{ISBN|978-0-486-42084-4}}.</ref> It is possible that he used an [[iteration|iterative]] procedure to calculate these values.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Of Calculations Past and Present: The Archimedean Algorithm {{!}} Mathematical Association of America|url=https://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/of-calculations-past-and-present-the-archimedean-algorithm|access-date=2021-04-14|website=www.maa.org|archive-date=14 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414012529/https://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/of-calculations-past-and-present-the-archimedean-algorithm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = The Computation of Pi by Archimedes|author = McKeeman, Bill|author-link = William M.

=== The infinite series ===
[[File:Parabolic segment and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|upright=.8|A proof that the area of the [[parabola|parabolic]] segment in the upper figure is equal to 4/3 that of the inscribed triangle in the lower figure from ''[[Quadrature of the Parabola]].'']]
In ''[[Quadrature of the Parabola]]'', Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is {{sfrac|4|3}} times the area of a corresponding inscribed [[triangle]] as shown in the figure at right. He expressed the solution to the problem as an [[Series (mathematics)#History of the theory of infinite series|infinite]] [[geometric series]] with the [[Geometric series#Common ratio r|common ratio]] {{sfrac|1|4}}:

:<math>\sum_{n=0}^\infty 4^{-n} = 1 + 4^{-1} + 4^{-2} + 4^{-3} + \cdots = {4\over 3}. \;</math>

If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller [[secant line]]s, and whose third vertex is where the line that is parallel to the parabola's axis and that passes through the midpoint of the base intersects the parabola, and so on. This proof uses a variation of the series {{nowrap|[[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·]]}} which sums to&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}.

=== Myriad of myriads ===
In ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote:<blockquote>There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of Hiero II), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited.</blockquote>To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the [[myriad]]. The word itself derives from the Greek {{Lang-grc|μυριάς|translit=murias|label=none}}, for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million, i.e., 10,000 x 10,000) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 [[Names of large numbers|vigintillion]], or 8{{e|63}}.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Sand Reckoner |first=Bradley W |last=Carroll|publisher = Weber State University| url = http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/sand.htm|access-date=23 July 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813215029/http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/sand.htm| archive-date= 13 August 2007| url-status= live}}</ref>

==== ''Measurement of a Circle'' ====
{{Main|Measurement of a Circle}}
This is a short work consisting of three propositions. It is written in the form of a correspondence with Dositheus of Pelusium, who was a student of [[Conon of Samos]]. In Proposition II, Archimedes gives an [[Approximations of π|approximation]] of the value of pi ({{pi}}), showing that it is greater than {{sfrac|223|71}} and less than {{sfrac|22|7}}.

==== ''The Sand Reckoner'' ====
{{Main|The Sand Reckoner}}
In this treatise, also known as '''''Psammites''''', Archimedes counts the number of [[Sand|grains of sand]] that will fit inside the universe. This book mentions the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of the [[Solar System|solar system]] proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]], as well as contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various [[celestial bodies]]. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the [[myriad]], Archimedes concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8{{e|63}} in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. ''The Sand Reckoner'' is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.<ref>{{cite web|title =English translation of ''The Sand Reckoner'' |publisher = [[University of Waterloo]]| url = http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/ideas/reckoner.shtml|access-date=23 July 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070811235335/http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/ideas/reckoner.shtml| archive-date= 11 August 2007| url-status= live}}</ref>

==== ''Quadrature of the Parabola'' ====
{{Main|Quadrature of the Parabola}}
In this work of 24 propositions addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes proves by two methods that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by the area of a [[triangle]] with equal base and height. He achieves this by calculating the value of a [[geometric series]] that sums to infinity with the [[ratio]] {{sfrac|1|4}}.

==== ''On the Equilibrium of Planes'' ====
{{Main|On the Equilibrium of Planes}}
There are two books to ''On the Equilibrium of Planes'': the first contains seven [[Axiom|postulates]] and fifteen [[proposition]]s, while the second book contains ten propositions. In the first work, Archimedes proves the ''[[Torque|Law of the lever]]'', which states that:

{{Blockquote|text=[[Magnitude (mathematics)|Magnitudes]] are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights.}}

Archimedes uses the principles derived to calculate the areas and [[center of mass|centers of gravity]] of various geometric figures including [[triangle]]s, [[parallelogram]]s and [[parabola]]s.<ref name="works">{{cite book|author=Heath, T.L.|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofarchimede029517mbp|title=The Works of Archimedes (1897).

==== ''On the Sphere and Cylinder'' ====
{{Main|On the Sphere and Cylinder}}
[[File:Esfera Arquímedes.svg|thumb|upright=.8|A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder including its bases.]]
In this two-volume treatise addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes obtains the result of which he was most proud, namely the relationship between a [[sphere]] and a [[circumscribe]]d [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and [[diameter]]. The volume is {{sfrac|4|3}}{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>3</sup> for the sphere, and 2{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>3</sup> for the cylinder. The surface area is 4{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>2</sup> for the sphere, and 6{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>2</sup> for the cylinder (including its two bases), where {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere and cylinder. The sphere has a volume {{nowrap|two-thirds}} that of the circumscribed cylinder. Similarly, the sphere has an area  {{nowrap|two-thirds}} that of the cylinder (including the bases).

==== ''On Spirals'' ====
{{Main|On Spirals}}
This work of 28 propositions is also addressed to Dositheus. The treatise defines what is now called the [[Archimedean spiral]]. It is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant [[angular velocity]]. Equivalently, in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] ({{math|''r''}}, {{math|θ}}) it can be described by the equation <math>\, r=a+b\theta</math>  with [[real number]]s {{math|a}} and {{math|b}}.

This is an early example of a [[Curve|mechanical curve]] (a curve traced by a moving [[point (geometry)|point]]) considered by a Greek mathematician.

==== ''On Conoids and Spheroids'' ====
{{Main|On Conoids and Spheroids}}
This is a work in 32 propositions addressed to Dositheus. In this treatise Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of [[cross section (geometry)|sections]] of [[Cone (geometry)|cones]], spheres, and paraboloids.

==== ''On Floating Bodies'' ====
{{Main|On Floating Bodies}}
In the first part of this two-volume treatise, Archimedes spells out the law of [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] of fluids and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity. This may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as [[Eratosthenes]] that the Earth is round. The fluids described by Archimedes are not {{nowrap|self-gravitating}} since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape.

In the second part, he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, similar to the way that icebergs float. Archimedes' [[Buoyancy|principle of buoyancy]] is given in the work, stated as follows:<blockquote>Any body wholly or partially immersed in fluid experiences an upthrust equal to, but opposite in sense to, the weight of the fluid displaced.</blockquote>

Also known as '''Loculus of Archimedes''' or '''Archimedes' Box''',<ref name=":1" /> this is a [[dissection puzzle]] similar to a [[Tangram]], and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the ''[[Archimedes Palimpsest]]''. Archimedes calculates the areas of the 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a [[square]]. Research published by Dr. [[Reviel Netz]] of [[Stanford University]] in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways.<ref>{{cite news|title = In Archimedes' Puzzle, a New Eureka Moment|author = Kolata, Gina|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = 14 December 2003|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E6DD133CF937A25751C1A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|access-date = 23 July 2007|archive-date = 14 July 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210714040608/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/us/in-archimedes-puzzle-a-new-eureka-moment.html|url-status = live}}</ref> The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Loculus of Archimedes, Solved|author= Ed Pegg Jr.| publisher =[[Mathematical Association of America]] |date = 17 November 2003| url = http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_11_17_03.html|access-date=18 May 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080519094951/http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_11_17_03.html| archive-date= 19 May 2008| url-status= live}}</ref> The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in [[combinatorics]].

==== The cattle problem ====
{{Main|Archimedes's cattle problem|l1 = Archimedes' cattle problem}}
This work was discovered by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the [[Herzog August Library]] in [[Wolfenbüttel]], Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the [[The Cattle of Helios|Herd of the Sun]] by solving a number of simultaneous [[Diophantine equation]]s. There is a more difficult version of the problem in which some of the answers are required to be [[square number]]s. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor<ref>Krumbiegel, B. and Amthor, A. ''Das Problema Bovinum des Archimedes'', Historisch-literarische Abteilung der Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik 25 (1880) pp. 121–136, 153–171.</ref> in 1880, and the answer is a [[very large number]], approximately 7.760271{{e|206544}}.<ref>{{cite web |first=Keith G |last=Calkins|url = http://www.andrews.edu/~calkins/profess/cattle.htm|title = Archimedes' Problema Bovinum| publisher = [[Andrews University]]|access-date = 14 September 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012171254/http://andrews.edu/~calkins/profess/cattle.htm|archive-date = 12 October 2007}}</ref>

==== ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems'' ====
{{Main|The Method of Mechanical Theorems}}
This treatise was thought lost until the discovery of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses [[Cavalieri's principle|indivisibles]],<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":9" /> and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the [[method of exhaustion]] to derive the results. As with ''[[Archimedes's cattle problem|The Cattle Problem]]'', ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems'' was written in the form of a letter to [[Eratosthenes]] in [[Alexandria]].

===Apocryphal works===
Archimedes' ''[[Book of Lemmas]]'' or ''Liber Assumptorum'' is a treatise with fifteen propositions on the nature of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The scholars [[T. L. Heath]] and [[Marshall Clagett]] argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes in its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The ''Lemmas'' may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.<ref>{{cite web|title = Archimedes' Book of Lemmas| publisher = [[cut-the-knot]]| url = http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/BookOfLemmas/index.shtml|access-date= 7 August 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711111858/http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/BookOfLemmas/index.shtml| archive-date= 11 July 2007| url-status= live}}</ref>

It has also been claimed that [[Heron's formula]] for calculating the area of a triangle from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes.<ref group="lower-alpha">[[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Boyer, Carl Benjamin]]. 1991. ''A History of Mathematics''. {{ISBN|978-0-471-54397-8}}: "Arabic scholars inform us that the familiar area formula for a triangle in terms of its three sides, usually known as Heron's formula — <math>k = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}</math>, where <math>s</math>  is the semiperimeter&nbsp;— was known to Archimedes several centuries before Heron lived.

===Archimedes Palimpsest===
{{main|Archimedes Palimpsest}}
[[File:Archimedes Palimpsest.jpg|thumb|In 1906, the Archimedes Palimpsest revealed works by Archimedes thought to have been lost.]]

The foremost document containing the work of Archimedes is the Archimedes Palimpsest. In 1906, the Danish professor [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] visited [[Constantinople]] to examined a 174-page [[Goatskin (material)|goatskin]] [[parchment]] of prayers, written in the 13th century AD, after reading a short transcription published seven years earlier by [[Athanasios Papadopoulos-Kerameus|Papadopoulos-Kerameus]].<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Nigel|date=2004|title=The Archimedes Palimpsest: A Progress Report|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20168629|journal=The Journal of the Walters Art Museum|volume=62|pages=61–68|jstor=20168629|issn=1946-0988}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Easton|first1=R.

Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as [[vellum]] was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously lost treatises by Archimedes.<ref name=":8" /><ref>{{cite magazine| title= Reading Between the Lines| author= Miller, Mary K.| magazine= [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]| date= March 2007| url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/archimedes.html| access-date= 24 January 2008| archive-date= 19 January 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080119024939/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/archimedes.html| url-status= live}}</ref> The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s.

The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of ''On Floating Bodies'' in the original Greek. It is the only known source of ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems'', referred to by [[Suda|Suidas]] and thought to have been lost forever. ''Stomachion'' was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts. The palimpsest was stored at the [[Walters Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where it was subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of [[ultraviolet]] and {{nowrap|[[X-ray]]}} [[light]] to read the overwritten text.<ref>{{cite news|title = X-rays reveal Archimedes' secrets|work = BBC News|date = 2 August 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5235894.stm|access-date=23 July 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070825091847/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5235894.stm| archive-date= 25 August 2007| url-status= live}}</ref> It has since returned to its anonymous owner.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Piñar|first=G.|last2=Sterflinger|first2=K.|last3=Ettenauer|first3=J.|last4=Quandt|first4=A.|last5=Pinzari|first5=F.|date=2015|title=A Combined Approach to Assess the Microbial Contamination of the Archimedes Palimpsest|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-014-0481-7|journal=Microbial Ecology|language=en|volume=69|issue=1|pages=118–134|pmid=25135817| doi=10.1007/s00248-014-0481-7 |pmc=4287661 |issn=1432-184X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Acerbi|first=F.|date=2013|title=R.

=== Mathematics and physics ===
[[File:FieldsMedalFront.jpg|thumb|The [[Fields Medal]] carries a portrait of Archimedes.]]
Historians of science and mathematics almost universally agree that Archimedes was the finest mathematician from antiquity. [[Eric Temple Bell]], for instance, wrote: 
{{block quote|Any list of the three “greatest” mathematicians of all history would include the name of Archimedes. The other two usually associated with him are [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]. Some, considering the relative wealth—or poverty—of mathematics and physical science in the respective ages in which these giants lived, and estimating their achievements against the background of their times, would put Archimedes first.<ref>E.T. Bell, Men of Mathematics, p 20.</ref>}}

Likewise, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[George F. Simmons]]  said of Archimedes:
{{block quote|... in the year 1500 Europe knew less than Archimedes who died in the year 212 BC ...<ref>{{cite web|author=Alfred North Whitehead|title=The Influence of Western Medieval Culture Upon the Development of Modern Science|url=https://inters.org/Whitehead-Western-Development-Science}}</ref>}}{{block quote|If we consider what all other men accomplished in mathematics and physics, on every continent and in every civilization, from the beginning of time down to the seventeenth century in Western Europe, the achievements of Archimedes outweighs it all. He was a great civilization all by himself.<ref>George F. Simmons, Calculus Gems: Brief Lives and Memorable Mathematics, p 43.</ref>}}
[[Reviel Netz]], Suppes Professor in Greek Mathematics and Astronomy at [[Stanford University]] and an expert in Archimedes notes:
{{block quote|And so, since Archimedes led more than anyone else to the formation of the calculus and since he was the pioneer of the application of mathematics to the physical world, it turns out that Western science is but a series of footnotes to Archimedes. Thus, it turns out that Archimedes is the most important scientist who ever lived.<ref>Reviel Netz, William Noel, The Archimedes Codex: Revealing The Secrets Of The World's Greatest Palimpsest</ref>}}

A test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the [[Skaramagas]] naval base outside [[Athens]]. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around {{Convert|5 x 3|ft|m|abbr=}}. The mirrors were pointed at a plywood {{nowrap|mock-up}} of a Roman warship at a distance of around {{Convert|160|ft|m|abbr=}}. When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds.

In October 2005 a group of students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30&nbsp;cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a {{nowrap|mock-up}} wooden ship at a range of around {{Convert|100|ft|m|abbr=}}. Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show ''[[MythBusters]]'', using a wooden fishing boat in [[San Francisco]] as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its [[autoignition temperature]], which is around {{Convert|300|C|F|abbr=}}.<ref>{{cite web|title = How Wildfires Work|author= Bonsor, Kevin| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/wildfire.htm|access-date=23 July 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070714174036/http://science.howstuffworks.com/wildfire.htm| archive-date= 14 July 2007 | url-status= live|date= 29 May 2001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Fuels and Chemicals – Auto Ignition Temperatures|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fuels-ignition-temperatures-d_171.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504022056/http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fuels-ignition-temperatures-d_171.html|archive-date=4 May 2015|access-date=1 December 2010}}</ref>

When ''MythBusters'' broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of "busted" (i.e. failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors. ''MythBusters'' also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.<ref name="death ray">{{cite web|title = Archimedes Death Ray: Testing with MythBusters|publisher = MIT|url = http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www//experiments/deathray/10_Mythbusters.html|access-date = 23 July 2007|archive-date = 20 June 2013|archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6HWnNtF1G?url=http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www//experiments/deathray/10_Mythbusters.html|url-status = live}}</ref>

In December 2010, ''MythBusters'' again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition entitled "[[MythBusters (2010 season)#Episode 157 – "President's Challenge"|President's Challenge]]".

The [[Fields Medal]] for outstanding achievement in mathematics carries a portrait of Archimedes, along with a carving illustrating his proof on the sphere and the cylinder. The inscription around the head of Archimedes is a quote attributed to 1st century AD poet [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], which reads in Latin: ''Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri'' ("Rise above oneself and grasp the world").<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Riehm|first=C.|date=2002|title=The early history of the Fields Medal|url=https://www.ams.org/notices/200207/comm-riehm.pdf|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=49|issue=7|pages=778–782|quote="The Latin inscription from the Roman poet Manilius surrounding the image may be translated 'To pass beyond your understanding and make yourself master of the universe.' The phrase comes from Manilius's Astronomica 4.392 from the first century A.D.

Archimedes has appeared on postage stamps issued by [[East Germany]] (1973), [[Greece]] (1983), [[Italy]] (1983), [[Nicaragua]] (1971), [[San Marino]] (1982), and [[Spain]] (1963).<ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres |url=http://math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Stamps/stamps.html |title=Stamps of Archimedes |publisher=Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences |access-date=25 August 2007 |archive-date=2 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002164026/http://math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Stamps/stamps.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The exclamation of [[Eureka (word)|Eureka!]] attributed to Archimedes is the state motto of [[California]]. In this instance, the word refers to the discovery of gold near [[Sutter's Mill]] in 1848 which sparked the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>{{cite web|title=California Symbols |publisher=California State Capitol Museum |url=http://www.capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?content1=1278&Content2=1374&Content3=1294 |access-date=14 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012123245/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?content1=1278&Content2=1374&Content3=1294 |archive-date=12 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
