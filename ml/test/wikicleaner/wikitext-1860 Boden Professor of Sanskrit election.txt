The election in 1860 for the position of [[Boden Professor of Sanskrit]] at the [[University of Oxford]] was a competition between two candidates offering different approaches to [[Sanskrit]] scholarship. One was [[Monier Williams]], an Oxford-educated Englishman who had spent 14 years teaching Sanskrit to those preparing to work in [[British India]] for the [[East India Company]]. The other, [[Max Müller]], was a German-born lecturer at Oxford specialising in [[comparative philology]], the science of language. He had spent many years working on an edition of the {{transl|sa|[[Rig Veda]]}} (an ancient collection of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] hymns) and had gained an international reputation for his scholarship. Williams, in contrast, worked on later material and had little time for the "continental" school of Sanskrit scholarship that Müller exemplified. Williams regarded the study of Sanskrit as a means to an end, namely the conversion of India to Christianity. In Müller's opinion, his own work, while it would assist missionaries, was also valuable as an end in itself.

The election came at a time of public debate about Britain's role in India in the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Opinions were divided on whether greater efforts should be made to convert India or whether to remain sensitive to local culture and traditions. Both men battled for the votes of the electorate (the [[Convocation]] of the university, consisting of over 3,700&nbsp;graduates) through manifestos and newspaper correspondence. Williams laid great stress in his campaign on the intention of the original founder of the chair, that the holder should assist in converting India through dissemination of the Christian scriptures. Müller's view was that his work on the {{transl|sa|Rig Veda}} was of great value for missionary work, and published testimonials accordingly. He also wanted to teach wider subjects such as Indian history and literature to assist missionaries, scholars, and civil servants&nbsp;– a proposal that Williams criticised as not in accordance with the original benefactor's wishes. The rival campaigns took out newspaper advertisements and circulated manifestos, and different newspapers backed each man. Although generally regarded as superior to Williams in scholarship, Müller had the double disadvantage (in the eyes of some) of being German and having liberal Christian views. Some of the newspaper pronouncements in favour of Williams were based on a claimed national interest of having an Englishman as Boden professor to assist with the work of governing and converting India.

Special trains to Oxford were provided on the day of the election, 7 December 1860, for non-resident members of Convocation to cast their votes. At the end of the hard-fought campaign, Williams won by a majority of over 220 votes. Thereafter, he helped to establish the [[Indian Institute]] at Oxford, received a knighthood, and held the chair until his death in 1899. Müller, although deeply disappointed by his defeat, remained in Oxford for the rest of his career, but never taught Sanskrit there. The 1860 election was the last time that Convocation chose the Boden professor, as this power was removed in 1882 as a result of reforms imposed by Parliament. {{As of|2017}}, the professorship is still in existence, and is now the last remaining Sanskrit professorship in the United Kingdom.

==Background==
{{main|Boden Professor of Sanskrit}}
{{further|Company rule in India|British Raj}}
The position of Boden professor at the [[University of Oxford]] was established by the bequest of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Joseph Boden of the [[Bombay Native Infantry]], who died in 1811. His will provided that on the death of his daughter (which occurred in 1827), his estate should pass to the university to fund a [[Sanskrit]] professorship. His purpose was to convert the people of India{{refn|At this time, "India" described the area covered by present-day India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh.<ref name=B178>Beckerlegge, p. 178.</ref>|group="n"}} to Christianity "by disseminating a knowledge of the Sacred scriptures among them".<ref name=Joseph>{{cite ODNB|first1=H.

The first Boden professor, [[Horace Hayman Wilson]], was elected in 1832 and died on 8 May 1860.<ref name=Wilson>{{cite ODNB|first=Paul B. |last=Courtright|title=Wilson, Horace Hayman (1786–1860)|year=2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/29657|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29657 |access-date=10 May 2012}} </ref> The election for his successor came at a time of public debate about the nature of British missionary work in India, particularly after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. The [[East India Company]], which [[Company rule in India|controlled the British territories]] until they were absorbed into the [[British Raj|British Empire]] in 1858, had had a general policy until 1813 of non-interference with Indian customs, including religion. Christian missionaries required a licence to proselytise. In practice, most could operate without a licence, except for [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]], who were regarded as too radical in an age when Christians from other backgrounds were more prepared to be tolerant of other faiths. As the Evangelical movement grew in strength, it pressed for greater efforts to bring Christianity to India, and so the company relaxed its approach to missionaries in 1813.<ref name=B186>Beckerlegge, p. 186.</ref> After 1858, the British government was reluctant to provoke further unrest by interference with local traditions and religion, but many of those charged with running India were themselves Evangelicals sympathetic to efforts to convert the country. As Beckerlegge has commented, "the furtherance of Christian mission had become inextricably bound up with attempts to define Britain's role in India and indeed to justify Britain's presence in India."<ref name=B187>Beckerlegge, p. 187.</ref> The issue was whether Britain was there simply to govern India or to "civilise" it, and if the latter, whether to draw up or destroy India's existing culture and religion.<ref name=B201/> Many of those who supported increased missionary work in India, says Beckerlegge, regarded the events of 1857 as "nothing less than a divine judgment" on Britain's failure to bring Christianity to the country.<ref name=B202>Beckerlegge, p. 202.</ref>

There were two schools of thought on whether Sanskrit should be taught for the purpose of assisting the administration and conversion of India, or for its own merits. The East India Company had provided instruction in Sanskrit to its employees at [[East India Company College|its college at Haileybury]], Hertfordshire, and the [[College of Fort William]] in Calcutta, to educate them in local culture. For some, this led to an interest in Indian religion and culture as revealed in the Sanskrit texts. This was in contrast to the situation in continental Europe, where scholars examined Sanskrit as part of the "science of language", [[comparative philology]], rather than for reasons of imperial administration. Fewer European scholars visited India, but many British Sanskritists had lived and worked there.<ref name=B188>Beckerlegge, p. 188.</ref> Some British scholars in other fields had strong doubts in any event about Sanskrit, as a "crude linguistic forgery pieced out of Latin and Greek", or as proving little "except a thoroughly unwelcome kinship between Briton and Brahmin", in the words of the American academic Linda Dowling.<ref name=D165>Dowling, p. 165.</ref>

Although five men indicated their intent to seek the chair in 1860 or were proposed in their absence, in the end the two who contested the election were [[Monier Williams]] and [[Max Müller]]. Williams (known later in life as Sir Monier Monier-Williams) was the son of an army officer and was born in India. He studied briefly at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], before training at Haileybury for the civil service in India. The death of his brother in battle in India led to him to return to Oxford to complete his degree. He also studied Sanskrit with Wilson before teaching this and other languages at Haileybury from 1844 until 1858, when it closed following the Indian rebellion.<ref name=WilliamsODNB>{{cite ODNB|first1=A.

Müller was from the German duchy of [[Anhalt-Dessau]] and took up Sanskrit at university as a fresh intellectual challenge after mastering Greek and Latin.<ref name=MullerODNB/> At this time, Sanskrit was a comparatively new subject of study in Europe, and its connections with the traditional classical languages had attracted interest from those examining the nature and history of languages.<ref name=B180>Beckerlegge, p. 180.</ref> He obtained his doctorate from [[Leipzig University]] in 1843, aged 19, and after a year studying in Berlin he began work in Paris on the first printed edition of the ''[[Rig Veda]]'' (an ancient collection of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] hymns). What was supposed to be a brief visit to England for research in 1846 turned into a lifelong stay. The Prussian diplomat [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen|Baron von Bunsen]] and Wilson persuaded the directors of the East India Company to provide financial support for [[Oxford University Press]] to publish the ''Rig Veda''. Müller settled in Oxford in 1848 and continued his Sanskrit research, becoming Taylorian Professor of Modern European Languages in 1854 after three years as the deputy professor;<ref name=MullerODNB/> in this post he was paid £500 per year, half the stipend of the Boden chair.<ref name=VDV108>Van der Veer, p. 108.</ref> A British subject from 1855, he was elected a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] in 1858,<ref name=MullerODNB>{{cite ODNB|first=R.

Three other scholars indicated an intention to stand for the chair, or were nominated by others, but withdrew before the ballot. The candidacy of [[Edward Byles Cowell|Edward Cowell]], Professor of Sanskrit at the Government College in Calcutta, was announced in ''The Times'' on 28 May 1860, where it was said that Wilson had pronounced him "eminently qualified" to succeed him.<ref name=Cowell>{{cite news|date=28 May 1860|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS101488316&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|title=University Intelligence|page=6|work=The Times|access-date=21 May 2012|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172104/https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=wes_ttda&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Faction%3Dinterpret%26id%3DGALE%7CCS101488316%26v%3D2.1%26u%3Dwes_ttda%26it%3Dr%26p%3DTTDA%26sw%3Dw&prodId=TTDA|url-status=live}}{{subscription required}}</ref> He later wrote from India refusing to stand against Müller.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS67540831&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|date=31 October 1860|title=University Intelligence|work=The Times|page=4|access-date=21 May 2012|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172036/https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=wes_ttda&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Faction%3Dinterpret%26id%3DGALE%7CCS67540831%26v%3D2.1%26u%3Dwes_ttda%26it%3Dr%26p%3DTTDA%26sw%3Dw&prodId=TTDA|url-status=live}}{{subscription required}}</ref> [[Ralph T.

He therefore considered that he had "spent the principal part of my life in promoting the object of the Founder of the Chair of Sanskrit."<ref name=B334>Beckerlegge, pp. 334–335.</ref> He promised to work exclusively on Sanskrit, and said that he would provide testimonials from "the most eminent Sanskrit scholars in Europe and India" and from missionaries who had used his publications to help "overthrow the ancient systems of idolatry" in India.<ref name=B334/> In due course, he was able to provide a list of missionary societies that had requested copies of the ''Rig Veda'' from the East India Company, including the [[Church Missionary Society]] and the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]].<ref name=B203/>

===Williams's manifesto===
{{wikisource|Monier Williams's submission to the members of Convocation of the University of Oxford, 1860|Monier Williams's election submission}}
Williams declared his intention to stand for election on 15 May 1860, one day after Müller.<ref>{{cite news|date=16 May 1860|title=University Intelligence|work=The Times|page=9|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS152344240&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|access-date=21 May 2012|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172038/https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=wes_ttda&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Faction%3Dinterpret%26id%3DGALE%7CCS152344240%26v%3D2.1%26u%3Dwes_ttda%26it%3Dr%26p%3DTTDA%26sw%3Dw&prodId=TTDA|url-status=live}}{{subscription required}}</ref> In his written submission to Convocation, he emphasised his suitability for appointment in the light of Boden's missionary wishes. After giving details of his life and career, particularly his experience in Sanskrit obtained at Haileybury, he stated that for the past 14 years "the one idea of my life has been to make myself thoroughly conversant with Sanskrit, and by every means in my power to facilitate the study of its literature."<ref name=B333>Beckerlegge, pp. 333–334.</ref> He assured voters that, if elected, "my utmost energies shall be devoted to the one object which its Founder had in view;—namely {{'}}''The promotion of a more general and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language, as a means of enabling Englishmen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion.''{{' "}}<ref name=B333/> Unlike Müller, he regarded the study of Sanskrit "as chiefly a means to the missionary conversion of the Hindus rather than as an end in itself", as Dowling puts it.<ref name=D165/> In this way, Dowling says, he could attempt to deflect attention from his "modest abilities in classical Sanskrit" when compared to Müller's "internationally acknowledged achievements".<ref name=D165/> Moreover, the appeal to Boden's original intentions came during a period when Convocation tended to pay little attention to the expressed wishes of benefactors.<ref name=B197>Beckerlegge, p. 197.</ref>

==Rival campaigns==
{{quote box|width=40%|title=Part of a handbill issued by supporters of Williams on 30 November 1860|quote=<poem>
There are Two Candidates, with ample Testimonials.
The Organs of Public Opinion have thought the contest not unworthy of their notice.
What then is the result?
By common consent both are pronounced scholars of world-wide reputation.
But one of them is specially and earnestly recommended to Convocation by a great number of our ''Countrymen'' in ''India itself''.
These ''Englishmen'', educated by him, grateful for his instruction, and personally attached to him, are a machinery existing ready to hand for the great work to be done.
They have no Votes to give, but their voice from that distant land should ring in our ears and hearts.
They know their man, they know the Natives, they are in daily communication with them. Is it wise to disregard their opinion?
The Professorship is not for Oxford alone.
It is not for 'The Continent and America'.
It is for India.
It is for Christianity.

In August 1860, Müller wrote to the members of Convocation about his plans to teach a broad range of topics in addition to Sanskrit, including comparative philology, Indian history, and literature. Simply teaching the language "would be but a mean return" for Boden's generosity, he wrote.<ref name=B198>Beckerlegge, p. 198.</ref> In this way, he would help to supply "efficient" missionaries, "useful" civil servants, and "distinguished" Boden scholars.<ref name=B199>Beckerlegge, p. 199.</ref>

In turn, Williams wrote that if Boden had left instructions that the man elected should be the one "most likely to secure a world-wide reputation for the Sanskrit Chair, I confess that I should have hesitated to prosecute my design."<ref name=C223>Chaudhuri, p. 223.</ref> However, this was not the case and it would be "unjustifiable" in terms of the statutes governing the chair if the professor were to lecture on wider topics. In his view, the Vedic literature was "of less importance" and the philosophical literature was "very mystical and abstruse", whereas "the classical or modern" period (the laws, two heroic poems, and the plays) was the "most important".<ref name=Williams2/> Reminding his readers that he had edited two Sanskrit plays, he stated that the literature of the third period constituted the Sanskrit scriptures, not ("as has hitherto been believed") the Veda, "still less the Rig Veda".<ref name=Williams2/> He commented that Müller's edition of the ''Rig Veda'' was requiring "an expenditure of time, labour, money, and erudition far greater than was ever bestowed on any edition of the Holy Bible", adding that Boden did not intend to "aid in the missionary work by perpetuating and diffusing the obsolescent Vedic Scriptures."<ref name=Williams2>{{cite news|date=22 October 1860|title=University Intelligence|work=The Times|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS119707478&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|page=7|access-date=21 May 2012|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172037/https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=wes_ttda&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Faction%3Dinterpret%26id%3DGALE%7CCS119707478%26v%3D2.1%26u%3Dwes_ttda%26it%3Dr%26p%3DTTDA%26sw%3Dw&prodId=TTDA|url-status=live}}{{subscription required}}</ref> He said his own approach to Sanskrit scholarship, with his dictionaries and grammar books, was "suited to English minds", unlike Müller's "continental" and "philosophical" approach, which dealt with texts no longer relevant to modern Hindus that missionaries would not benefit from studying.<ref name=B199/>

In a letter to ''The Times'' published on 29 October 1860, Müller took issue with Williams. To the claim that it would be unjustifiable to teach history, philosophy, and other subjects as Boden professor, he quoted from one of Wilson's public lectures in which he had said that it had always been his intention to offer "a general view of the institutions and social condition, the literature, and religion of the Hindus."<ref name=Muller2/> He noted that he had published in all three areas into which Williams divided Sanskrit literature, and disputed Williams's views on the relative importance of Vedic literature with reference to a review of one of his publications by Wilson. Williams, he said, "stands as yet alone" in asserting that the heroic poems and the plays, not the Vedas, were the real scriptures.<ref name=Muller2/> He refused to accept Williams's estimate of the labour involved in the edition of the ''Rig Veda'', and said that to compare his little effort with that carried out on the Bible was "almost irreverent".<ref name=Muller2/> He concluded by attempting to rebut the claim that Boden would not have wanted the Vedic scriptures to be supported. He noted that the [[Anglican Diocese of Calcutta|Bishop of Calcutta]] ([[George Cotton]]) had written that it was of "the greatest importance" for missionaries to study Sanskrit and its scriptures "to be able to meet the Pundits on their own ground", and that the bishop's view was that nothing could be more valuable in this work than Müller's edition, and Wilson's translation, of the ''Rig-Veda''."<ref name=Muller2>{{cite news|work=The Times|date=29 October 1860|last=Müller|first=Max|page=7|title=Sanskrit Professorship|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS118527837&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|access-date=21 May 2012|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172034/https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=wes_ttda&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Faction%3Dinterpret%26id%3DGALE%7CCS118527837%26v%3D2.1%26u%3Dwes_ttda%26it%3Dr%26p%3DTTDA%26sw%3Dw&prodId=TTDA|url-status=live}}{{subscription required}}</ref>{{refn|The letter from Cotton is reproduced in full in Müller, pp. 236–237.|group="n"}}

After this letter, Williams complained about Müller conducting his campaign in the newspapers and misrepresenting what Williams was saying.<ref name=B201/> Müller asked three professors and the Provost of [[Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College]] to consider the accuracy of his letter, and they pronounced in his favour.<ref name=C227>Chaudhuri, p. 227.</ref> In Beckerlegge's view, all these replies and counter-replies did was "illustrate the increasingly heated tone of the exchanges" between the two men and their supporters.<ref name=B201>Beckerlegge, p. 201.</ref> It was "as if the protagonists were prospective members of Parliament", in the words of one modern scholar.<ref name=Evison2/> Terence Thomas, a British lecturer in religious studies, records "insults regarding the nationality of Max Müller and the proficiency of Monier Williams as a Sanskritist being bandied back and forth by their supporters."<ref name=T85>Thomas, p. 85.</ref> For example, one of the Boden scholars at Oxford, Robinson Ellis, said Williams had not been able to prove that he could read a Sanskrit text. When challenged, he later amended this to a claim that Williams could only read a text when he could compare it to another one, describing this as "mechanical labour which is paid for at the public libraries at Paris and Berlin at the rate of half a crown a year."<ref name=Evison3>Evison, p. 3.</ref>

According to Beckerlegge, there was a view held by many of those involved in the keenly fought struggle between Williams and Müller that more depended on the result than simply one man's career&nbsp;– missionary success or failure in India, "and even the future stability of British rule in this region" (in the light of events in India a few years previously) might depend on the abilities of the Boden professor.<ref name=B178/> Victory would depend on each side's ability to persuade non-resident members of Convocation to return to Oxford to cast their votes.<ref name="B193"/> Each candidate had their supporters: Müller was backed by scholars of international merit, whereas Williams was able to call upon Oxford-based academics and those who had served in India as administrators or missionaries.<ref name="B193" /> Both candidates claimed support from Wilson&nbsp;– "as if the principle of apostolic succession was involved in the appointment", says Chaudhuri.<ref name="C226" /> ''The Times'' reported on 23 May that friends of Williams placed considerable weight upon a private letter to him from Wilson, "indicating Mr. Williams as his probable successor."<ref name=rivals/> In return, Wilson was revealed to have said "two months before his death" that "Mr. Max Müller was the first Sanskrit scholar in Europe".<ref name=rivals>{{cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS151295671&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|title=University Intelligence|date=23 May 1860|page=9|work=The Times|access-date=21 May 2012|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172034/https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=wes_ttda&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Faction%3Dinterpret%26id%3DGALE%7CCS151295671%26v%3D2.1%26u%3Dwes_ttda%26it%3Dr%26p%3DTTDA%26sw%3Dw&prodId=TTDA|url-status=live}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The source of this information was [[William Sandys Wright Vaux|W.

On 5 December 1860, two days before the election, friends of Müller took out an advertisement in ''The Times'' to list his supporters, in response to a similar record circulated on behalf of Williams. By then, Müller's list included the heads of 11 colleges or halls of the university, 27 professors, over 40 college fellows and tutors, and many non-resident members of the university including [[Samuel Wilberforce]] (the [[Bishop of Oxford]]) and [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Sir Charles Wood]] (the Secretary of State for India).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS100833157&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|title=Boden Professorship of Sanskrit at Oxford|date=5 December 1860|page=6|work=The Times|access-date=21 May 2012|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172034/https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=wes_ttda&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Faction%3Dinterpret%26id%3DGALE%7CCS100833157%26v%3D2.1%26u%3Dwes_ttda%26it%3Dr%26p%3DTTDA%26sw%3Dw&prodId=TTDA|url-status=live}}{{subscription required}}</ref> A list published on the following day added the name of [[Charles Longley]], [[Archbishop of York]], to Müller's supporters.<ref name=trains/> Overall, the public supporters for each candidate were about the same in number, but while Müller was backed by "all the noted Orientalists of Europe of the age", Williams's supporters "were not so distinguished", according to Chaudhuri.<ref name=C221/><ref name=C222>Chaudhuri, p. 222.</ref>{{refn|After the election, Müller's wife records that one voter said that if the ballots had been measured by weight, there would have been "no doubt" about the matter.<ref>Müller, p. 242</ref>|group="n"}}

Newspapers and journals joined the debate, some in strong terms. One evangelical publication, ''The Record'', contrasted the two candidates: Müller's writings were "familiar to all persons interested in literature, while they have destroyed confidence in his religious opinions"; Williams was described as "a man of sincere piety, and one who is likely, by the blessing of God on his labours, to promote the ultimate object which the founder of the Professorship had in view."<ref name=BQ196>Quoted in Beckerlegge, p. 196.</ref> Other newspapers highlighted the nationalities of the candidates; as Beckerlegge has put it, "voting for the Boden Chair was increasingly taking on the appearance of being a test of patriotism."<ref name=B196>Beckerlegge, p. 196.</ref> ''The Homeward Mail'' (a London-based newspaper that concentrated on news from, and relating to, India)<ref>{{cite book|first=Chandrika|last=Kaul|title=Reporting the Raj: The British Press and India C. 1880–1922|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2003|pages=87–88|isbn=978-0-7190-6176-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmPSSu9KyucC&q=%22homeward+mail%22|access-date=7 November 2020|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172032/https://books.google.com/books?id=mmPSSu9KyucC&q=%22homeward+mail%22|url-status=live}}</ref> asked its readers whether they wanted "a stranger and a foreigner" to win, or "one of your own body".<ref name=BQ196/> A writer in ''[[The Morning Post]]'' said that voters should "keep the great prizes of the English universities for English students".<ref name=BQ196/> The ''[[Morning Herald]]'' said that it was "a question of national interest", since it would affect the education of civil servants and missionaries and therefore "the progress of Christianity in India and the maintenance of British authority in that empire".<ref name=BQ196/> It anticipated that Britain would be ridiculed if it had to appoint a German to its leading academic Sanskrit position.<ref name=BQ196/>

Müller was not without support in the press.

Pusey, the influential "[[high church]]" Anglican theologian associated with the [[Oxford Movement]], wrote a letter of support to Müller, reproduced in ''The Times''. In his view, Boden's intentions would be best advanced by electing Müller. Missionaries could not win converts without knowing the details of the religion of those with whom they were dealing, he wrote, and Müller's publications were "the greatest gifts which have yet been bestowed" on those in such work.<ref name=Pusey/> He added that Oxford would gain by electing him to a position where Müller could spend all his time on work "of such primary and lasting importance for the conversion of India."<ref name=Pusey>{{cite news|title=The Boden Professorship of Sanskrit|last=Pusey|first=Edward|author-link=Edward Bouverie Pusey|work=The Times|page=9|date=11 June 1860|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS152344267&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|access-date=21 May 2012|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172129/https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=wes_ttda&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Faction%3Dinterpret%26id%3DGALE%7CCS152344267%26v%3D2.1%26u%3Dwes_ttda%26it%3Dr%26p%3DTTDA%26sw%3Dw&prodId=TTDA|url-status=live}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Beckerlegge finds Pusey's support noteworthy, since Pusey would not have agreed with Müller's particular "broad" approach to Christianity, and was thus providing a judgment on the academic abilities of the candidate best placed to advance missionary work in India.<ref name=B203>Beckerlegge, p. 203.</ref> One anonymous writer of a letter to the press in support of Müller, shortly before the election, expressed it thus: "A man's personal character must stand very high, and his theological opinions can afford but little ground for animadversion on either hand, when he unites as his unhesitating supporters Dr. Pusey and Dr. Macbride"<ref>Müller, pp. 241–242.</ref>&nbsp;– a reference to [[John Macbride (professor)|John Macbride]], described in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' as "a profoundly religious layman of the 'old' evangelical school".<ref>{{cite ODNB|first=R.

Müller attributed his defeat to his German background and suspicions that his Christianity was insufficiently orthodox, factors that had been used to influence in particular those voters who were no longer resident members of the university.<ref name=B195/> He had lost, he wrote, because of "calumnious falsehood and vulgar electioneering tactics."<ref name=D164/> Williams wrote in his unpublished autobiography that he had been "favoured by circumstances" and that, unlike Müller, he had been regarded as politically and religiously conservative.<ref name=B195>Beckerlegge, p. 195.</ref>

Williams served as Boden professor until his death in 1899, although he retired from teaching (while retaining the title) in 1887 because of his health.<ref name=WilliamsODNB/> He took as the title for his inaugural lecture "The Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work", in keeping with his views as to the role of the chair. Thomas notes that as the East India Company had switched to using English rather than Sanskrit or Persian for its work, "a natural source of students had already dried up not long after the Boden Chair was inaugurated [in 1832]".<ref name=T86>Thomas, p. 86.</ref> Williams helped establish the [[Indian Institute]] at Oxford, proposing the idea in 1875 and helping to raise funds for the project on his visits to India, and persuaded the university to add a degree course in oriental studies. His publications included translations of plays and grammatical works. He received a knighthood in 1886, and was appointed a [[Order of the Indian Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire]] in 1887, when he changed his surname to become Sir Monier Monier-Williams.<ref name=WilliamsODNB/>

Robinson Ellis was required to attend Williams's lectures despite his low opinions of the new professor's abilities. Williams said that Ellis's "whole demeanour was that of a person who would have welcomed an earthquake or any convulsion of nature which would have opened a way for him to sink out of my sight".<ref name=Evison3/> Overall, Williams won over most of those who had opposed his election, with the exception of Müller.<ref name=Evison3/>

For Müller, losing the election was "a decisive turning point in his scholarly and intellectual life", according to Chaudhuri.<ref name=C220/> It meant that Müller was never to teach Sanskrit at Oxford, although he remained there until his death in 1900;<ref name=Kochhar/> nor did he ever visit India.<ref name=B188/> Greatly disappointed by not winning the chair, Müller "regularly avoided or snubbed Monier Williams and his family on the streets of Oxford", according to Williams.<ref name=B183>Beckerlegge, p. 183.</ref> He was appointed to a chair of comparative philology in 1868, the first Oxford professorship to be established by the university itself without money from royal or private donations.<ref name=Twaddle/> He wrote a letter of resignation in 1875 when the university proposed to award an honorary doctorate to Williams, giving as his reason that he wanted to spend more time studying Sanskrit. Friends attempted to talk him out of it, and the university then appointed a deputy professor to discharge his duties, an honour he greatly appreciated.<ref>Chaudhuri, pp. 232–234.</ref>

The Indian historian Rajesh Kochhar, noting the East India Company's support for Müller, commented that "Oxford professors may have had their own reasons for their assessment of him, but the Company and the natives both found him very relevant."<ref name=Kochhar>{{cite journal|last=Kochhar|first=Rajesh|title=Seductive Orientalism: English Education and Modern Science in Colonial India|journal=[[Social Scientist]]|jstor=27644269|volume=36|page=54|date=March–April 2008|issue=3/4}}</ref> Despite his electoral defeat, he enjoyed a high reputation at Oxford and beyond: he "occupied a central role in the intellectual life of the nation", according to Beckerlegge,<ref name=B179>Beckerlegge, p. 179.</ref> and was "viewed by the world as a model of academic success" (as Dowling puts it).<ref name=D160>Dowling, p. 160.</ref> Dowling considers that "[w]ithin his own lifetime, Müller was discredited as a linguistic scientist" and has "little relevance" to later models of the study of language.<ref name=D160/> In Beckerlegge's opinion, Müller's views about the nature of Christian missionary work showed the difficulty at that time for Christian academics "actively working to promote a more tolerant and even-handed study of other religious traditions".<ref name=B173>Beckerlegge, p. 173.</ref>
