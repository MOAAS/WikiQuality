In [[energy metabolism]], glucose is the most important source of energy in all [[organism]]s. Glucose for metabolism is stored as a [[polymer]], in plants mainly as [[starch]] and [[amylopectin]], and in animals as [[glycogen]]. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as [[blood sugar]]. The naturally occurring form of glucose is {{sm|d}}-glucose, while [[L-glucose|{{sm|l}}-glucose]] is produced synthetically in comparatively small amounts and is of lesser importance {{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}. Glucose is a [[monosaccharide]] containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an [[aldohexose]]. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form. Glucose is naturally occurring and is found in its free state in fruits and other parts of plants. In animals, glucose is released from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as [[glycogenolysis]].

Glucose, as [[intravenous sugar solution]], is on the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]].<ref name="WHO21st">{{cite book | vauthors = ((World Health Organization)) | title = World Health Organization model list of essential medicines: 21st list 2019 | year = 2019 | hdl = 10665/325771 | author-link = World Health Organization | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva | id = WHO/MVP/EMP/IAU/2019.06.

Glucose is the term coined by [[Jean Baptiste Dumas]] in 1838, which has prevailed in the chemical literature. [[Friedrich August Kekulé]] proposed the term dextrose (from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|dexter}}, meaning "right"), because in aqueous solution of glucose, the plane of linearly polarized light is turned to the right. In contrast, {{sm|l}}-fructose (a ketohexose) and {{sm|l}}-glucose turn linearly polarized light to the left. The earlier notation according to the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light (''d'' and ''l''-nomenclature) was later abandoned in favor of the {{sm|d}}- and {{sm|l}}-notation, which refers to the absolute configuration of the asymmetric center farthest from the carbonyl group, and in concordance with the configuration of {{sm|d}}- or {{sm|l}}-glyceraldehyde.<ref name="Robyt 7">John F.

Since glucose is a basic necessity of many organisms, a correct understanding of its [[chemical]] makeup and structure contributed greatly to a general advancement in [[organic chemistry]]. This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]], a German chemist who received the 1902 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his findings.<ref>{{citation | title = Emil Fischer | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html | publisher = Nobel Foundation | access-date = 2009-09-02 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090903164859/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html | archive-date = 2009-09-03 }}</ref> The synthesis of glucose established the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]]'s theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules.<ref>{{citation | title = van't Hoff's Glucose | first = Bert | last = Fraser-Reid | journal = Chem.

The names initially referred to the natural substances. Their enantiomers were given the same name with the introduction of systematic nomenclatures, taking into account absolute stereochemistry (e.g. Fischer nomenclature, {{sm|d}}/{{sm|l}} nomenclature).

===Structure and nomenclature===
[[File:Mutarotation D-Glucose V.1.png|thumb|center|Mutarotation of glucose]]
Glucose is usually present in solid form as a [[monohydrate]] with a closed [[pyran]] ring (dextrose hydrate). In aqueous solution, on the other hand, it is an open-chain to a small extent and is present predominantly as α- or β-[[pyranose]], which interconvert (see [[mutarotation]]). From aqueous solutions, the three known forms can be crystallized: α-glucopyranose, β-glucopyranose and β-glucopyranose hydrate.<ref name="Ullmann">{{Cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a12_457.pub2 |chapter=Glucose and Glucose-Containing Syrups |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2006 |last1=Schenck |first1=Fred W. |isbn=978-3527306732}}</ref> Glucose is a building block of the disaccharides [[lactose]] and [[sucrose]] (cane or beet sugar), of [[oligosaccharide]]s such as [[raffinose]] and of polysaccharides such as [[starch]] and [[amylopectin]], [[glycogen]] or [[cellulose]].

===Open-chain form===
[[Image:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif|thumb|Glucose can exist in both a straight-chain and ring form.]]
The open-chain form of glucose makes up less than 0.02% of the glucose molecules in an aqueous solution. The rest is one of two cyclic hemiacetal forms. In its [[open-chain]] form, the glucose molecule has an open (as opposed to [[cyclic compound|cyclic]]) unbranched backbone of six carbon atoms, where C-1 is part of an [[aldehyde group]] {{chem2|H(C\dO)\s}}. Therefore, glucose is also classified as an [[aldose]], or an [[aldohexose]]. The aldehyde group makes glucose a [[reducing sugar]] giving a positive reaction with the [[Fehling test]].

}}
In solutions, the open-chain form of glucose (either "{{small|D}}-" or "{{small|L}}-") exists in equilibrium with several [[Carbohydrate#Ring-straight chain isomerism|cyclic isomers]], each containing a ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom. In aqueous solution, however, more than 99% of glucose molecules exist as [[pyranose]] forms. The open-chain form is limited to about 0.25%, and [[furanose]] forms exist in negligible amounts. The terms "glucose" and "{{small|D}}-glucose" are generally used for these cyclic forms as well. The ring arises from the open-chain form by an intramolecular [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction between the aldehyde group (at C-1) and either the C-4 or C-5 hydroxyl group, forming a [[hemiacetal]] linkage, {{chem2|\sC(OH)H\sO\s}}.

The reaction between C-1 and C-5 yields a six-membered [[heterocycle|heterocyclic]] system called a pyranose, which is a monosaccharide sugar (hence "-ose") containing a derivatised [[pyran]] skeleton. The (much rarer) reaction between C-1 and C-4 yields a five-membered furanose ring, named after the cyclic ether [[furan]]. In either case, each carbon in the ring has one hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached, except for the last carbon (C-4 or C-5) where the hydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule (which is {{chem2|\s(C(CH2OH)HOH)\sH}} or {{chem2|\s(CHOH)\sH}} respectively).

The ring-closing reaction can give two products, denoted "α-" and "β-". When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in the [[Haworth projection]], the designation "α-" means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the {{chem2|\sCH2OH}} group at C-5 lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane (a[[cis–trans isomerism|'' trans'']] arrangement), while "β-" means that they are on the same side of the plane (a[[cis–trans isomerism|'' cis'']] arrangement). Therefore, the open-chain isomer {{small|D}}-glucose gives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers: α-{{small|D}}-glucopyranose, β-{{small|D}}-glucopyranose, α-{{small|D}}-glucofuranose, and β-{{small|D}}-glucofuranose. These five structures exist in equilibrium and interconvert, and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid [[catalysis]].

}}
The other open-chain isomer {{small|L}}-glucose similarly gives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of {{small|L}}-glucose, each the mirror image of the corresponding {{small|D}}-glucose.

The glucopyranose ring (α or β) can assume several non-planar shapes, analogous to the "chair" and "boat" conformations of [[cyclohexane]]. Similarly, the glucofuranose ring may assume several shapes, analogous to the "envelope" conformations of [[cyclopentane]].

In the solid state, only the glucopyranose forms are observed.

Some derivatives of glucofuranose, such as [[1,2-O-isopropylidene-D-glucofuranose|1,2-''O''-isopropylidene-{{sc|D}}-glucofuranose]] are stable and can be obtained pure as crystalline solids.<ref name=taka1979>{{cite journal | last1 = Takagi | first1 = S. | last2 = Jeffrey | first2 = G.

===Mutarotation===
[[File:Mutarotation D-Glucose V.1.png|thumb|upright=2|Mutarotation: {{sm|d}}-glucose molecules exist as cyclic hemiacetals that are epimeric (= diastereomeric) to each other. The epimeric ratio α:β is 36:64. In the α-D-glucopyranose (left), the blue-labelled hydroxy group is in the axial position at the anomeric centre, whereas in the β-D-glucopyranose (right) the blue-labelled hydroxy group is in equatorial position at the anomeric centre.]]
Mutarotation consists of a temporary reversal of the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming of the ring. The ring closure step may use a different {{chem2|\sOH}} group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one (thus switching between the α and β forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely detectable in solution, it is an essential component of the equilibrium.

The open-chain form is [[Chemical stability|thermodynamically unstable]], and it spontaneously [[isomer]]izes to the cyclic forms. (Although the ring closure reaction could in theory create four- or three-atom rings, these would be highly strained, and are not observed in practice.) In solutions at [[room temperature]], the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called [[mutarotation]].<ref>{{McMurry2nd | page = 866}}.</ref> Starting from any proportions, the mixture converges to a stable ratio of α:β 36:64.<!--AT ANY TEMPERATURE?--> The ratio would be α:β 11:89 if it were not for the influence of the [[anomeric effect]].<ref>{{citation | title = The Anomeric Effect | last1 = Juaristi | first1 = Eusebio | first2 = Gabriel | last2 = Cuevas | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 9–10 | isbn = 978-0-8493-8941-2}}</ref> Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures close to {{convert|0|C}}.

===Optical activity===
Whether in water or the solid form, {{sm|d}}-(+)-glucose is [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]], meaning it will rotate the direction of [[polarized light]] clockwise as seen looking toward the light source. The effect is due to the [[chirality]] of the molecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, {{sm|l}}-(−)-glucose, is [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] (rotates polarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for each of the five [[tautomer]]s.

Note that the {{sm|d}}- prefix does not refer directly to the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral centre has the same handedness as that of {{sm|d}}-glyceraldehyde (which was so labelled because it is dextrorotatory). The fact that {{sm|d}}-glucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centres, not just of C-5; and indeed some of the other {{sm|d}}-aldohexoses are levorotatory.<!--CHECK-->

The conversion between the two anomers can be observed in a [[polarimeter]] since pure α-{{sm|d}}glucose has a specific rotation angle of +112.2°·ml/(dm·g), pure β- D- glucose of +17.5°·ml/(dm·g).<ref name=" Hesse">Manfred Hesse, Herbert Meier, Bernd Zeeh, Stefan Bienz, Laurent Bigler, Thomas Fox: ''Spektroskopische Methoden in der organischen Chemie''. 8th revised Edition. Georg Thieme, 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-13-160038-7}}, p. 34 (in German).</ref> When equilibrium has been reached after a certain time due to mutarotation, the angle of rotation is +52.7°·ml/(dm·g).<ref name="Hesse" /> By adding acid or base, this transformation is much accelerated. The equilibration takes place via the open-chain aldehyde form.

===Isomerisation===
In dilute [[sodium hydroxide]] or other dilute bases, the monosaccharides [[mannose]], glucose and [[fructose]] interconvert (via a [[Lobry de Bruyn–Van Ekenstein transformation|Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda–Van Ekenstein transformation]]), so that a balance between these isomers is formed. This reaction proceeds via an [[enediol]]:

Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide. Glucose is also the most widely used aldohexose in most living organisms. One possible explanation for this is that glucose has a lower tendency than other aldohexoses to react nonspecifically with the [[amine]] groups of [[protein]]s.<ref name=Higgins>{{cite journal|last1=Bunn|first1=H.

Polysaccharides that are composed solely of glucose are termed [[glucan]]s.

Glucose is produced by plants through the photosynthesis using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and can be used by all living organisms as an energy and carbon source. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and others which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and [[chitin]], which are components of the cell wall in plants or [[fungi]] and [[arthropod]]s, respectively. These polymers, when consumed by animals, fungi and bacteria, are degraded to glucose using enzymes. All animals are also able to produce glucose themselves from certain precursors as the need arises. [[Neuron]]s, cells of the [[renal medulla]] and [[erythrocytes]] depend on glucose for their energy production.<ref name="Löffler/Petrides 195">Peter C.

Many of the long-term complications of [[diabetes]] (e.g., [[Visual impairment|blindness]], [[kidney failure]], and [[peripheral neuropathy]]) are probably due to the glycation of proteins or [[lipid]]s.<ref>{{citation | title = High Blood Glucose and Diabetes Complications: The buildup of molecules known as AGEs may be the key link | journal = Diabetes Forecast | url = http://forecast.diabetes.org/magazine/features/high-blood-glucose-and-diabetes-complications | year = 2010 | publisher = American Diabetes Association | issn = 0095-8301 | access-date = 2010-05-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014173838/http://forecast.diabetes.org/magazine/features/high-blood-glucose-and-diabetes-complications | archive-date = 2013-10-14 | url-status = dead }}</ref> In contrast, [[enzyme]]-regulated addition of sugars to protein is called [[glycosylation]] and is essential for the function of many proteins.<ref name="varki">{{Cite book|edition = 2nd|publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press|isbn = 978-0-87969-770-9| others = Ajit Varki (ed.)|title = Essentials of Glycobiology|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1908/|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161206081633/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1908/|archive-date = 2016-12-06|year = 2009}}</ref>

===Uptake===
Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins [[T1R2]] and [[T1R3]] makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food&mdash;about {{cvt|300|g}} per day is produced by conversion of food,<ref name="Löffler/Petrides 404">Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&nbsp;404.</ref> but it is also synthesized from other metabolites in the body's cells. In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing polysaccharides happens in part already during [[chewing]] by means of [[amylase]], which is contained in [[saliva]], as well as by [[maltase]], [[lactase]], and [[sucrase]] on the [[brush border]] of the [[small intestine]]. Glucose is a building block of many carbohydrates and can be split off from them using certain enzymes. [[Glucosidases]], a subgroup of the glycosidases, first catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain glucose-containing polysaccharides, removing terminal glucose. In turn, disaccharides are mostly degraded by specific glycosidases to glucose. The names of the degrading enzymes are often derived from the particular poly- and disaccharide; inter alia, for the degradation of polysaccharide chains there are amylases (named after amylose, a component of starch), cellulases (named after cellulose), chitinases (named after chitin), and more. Furthermore, for the cleavage of disaccharides, there are maltase, lactase, sucrase, [[trehalase]], and others. In humans, about 70 genes are known that code for glycosidases. They have functions in the digestion and degradation of glycogen, [[sphingolipid]]s, [[mucopolysaccharides]], and poly([[Adenosine diphosphate ribose|ADP-ribose]]). Humans do not produce cellulases, chitinases, or trehalases, but the bacteria in the [[gut microbiota]] do.

In order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins from the [[major facilitator superfamily]].

The metabolic pathway that begins with molecules containing two to four carbon atoms (C) and ends in the glucose molecule containing six carbon atoms is called gluconeogenesis and occurs in all living organisms.

Gluconeogenesis allows the organism to build up glucose from other metabolites, including [[lactic acid|lactate]] or certain amino acids, while consuming energy. The renal [[tubular cell]]s can also produce glucose.

Glucose also can be found outside of living organisms in the ambient environment. Glucose concentrations in the atmosphere are detected via collection of samples by aircraft and are known to vary from location to location.

Use of glucose as an energy source in cells is by either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation. The first step of glycolysis is the [[phosphorylation]] of glucose by a [[hexokinase]] to form [[glucose 6-phosphate]]. The main reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent its diffusion out of the cell as the charged [[phosphate]] group prevents glucose 6-phosphate from easily crossing the [[cell membrane]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bonadonna|first1=Riccardo C|last2=Bonora|first2=Enzo|last3=Del Prato|first3=Stefano|last4=Saccomani|first4=Maria|last5=Cobelli|first5=Claudio|last6=Natali|first6=Andrea|last7=Frascerra|first7=Silvia|last8=Pecori|first8=Neda|last9=Ferrannini|first9=Eleuterio|last10=Bier|first10=Dennis|last11=DeFronzo|first11=Ralph A|last12=Gulli|first12=Giovanni|title=Roles of glucose transport and glucose phosphorylation in muscle insulin resistance of NIDDM|journal=Diabetes|date=July 1996|volume=45|issue=7|pages=915–25|doi=10.2337/diab.45.7.915|pmid=8666143|s2cid=219249555|url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/45/7/915.full-text.pdf|access-date=March 5, 2017}}</ref> Furthermore, addition of the high-energy phosphate group [[Activation#Biochemistry|activates]] glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis.

Some glucose is converted to [[lactic acid]] by [[astrocyte]]s, which is then utilized as an energy source by [[brain cells]]; some glucose is used by intestinal cells and [[red blood cell]]s, while the rest reaches the [[liver]], [[adipose tissue]] and [[muscle]] cells, where it is absorbed and stored as glycogen (under the influence of [[insulin]]). Liver cell glycogen can be converted to glucose and returned to the blood when insulin is low or absent; muscle cell glycogen is not returned to the blood because of a lack of enzymes. In [[Adipocyte|fat cells]], glucose is used to power reactions that synthesize some [[fat]] types and have other purposes. Glycogen is the body's "glucose energy storage" mechanism, because it is much more "space efficient" and less reactive than glucose itself.

===Precursor===
Organisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances. [[Starch]], [[cellulose]], and [[glycogen]] ("animal starch") are common glucose [[polymer]]s ([[polysaccharide]]s). Some of these polymers (starch or glycogen) serve as energy stores, while others (cellulose and [[chitin]], which is made from a derivative of glucose) have structural roles. [[Oligosaccharide]]s of glucose combined with other sugars serve as important energy stores. These include [[lactose]], the predominant sugar in milk, which is a glucose-galactose disaccharide, and [[sucrose]], another disaccharide which is composed of glucose and [[fructose]]. Glucose is also added onto certain proteins and [[lipid]]s in a process called [[glycosylation]]. This is often critical for their functioning. The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules usually use [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling it with the breaking of the glucose-phosphate bond.

Other than its direct use as a monomer, glucose can be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules. This is important, as glucose serves both as a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon. Glucose can be broken down and converted into [[lipid]]s. It is also a precursor for the synthesis of other important molecules such as [[vitamin C]] (ascorbic acid). In living organisms, glucose is converted to several other chemical compounds that are the starting material for various [[metabolic pathway]]s. Among them, all other monosaccharides<ref name="Löffler/Petrides 27">Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.''

Glucose can also be converted from bacterial [[xylose isomerase]] to fructose. In addition, glucose [[metabolite]]s produce all nonessential [[amino acid]]s, [[sugar alcohol]]s such as [[mannitol]] and [[sorbitol]], [[fatty acid]]s, [[cholesterol]] and [[nucleic acid]]s.<ref name="Löffler/Petrides 27" /> Finally, glucose is used as a building block in the [[glycosylation]] of proteins to [[glycoprotein]]s, [[glycolipid]]s, [[peptidoglycan]]s, [[glycoside]]s and other substances (catalyzed by [[glycosyltransferase]]s) and can be cleaved from them by [[glycosidase]]s.

[[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]] is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate [[Blood sugar|levels of glucose in the blood]] either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin.

Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions.<ref>Estela, Carlos (2011) "Blood Glucose Levels," Undergraduate Journal of Mathematical Modeling: One + Two: Vol. 3: Iss. 2, Article 12.</ref> If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the [[beta cell|insulin-producing cells]] in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes.

To monitor the body's response to blood glucose-lowering therapy, glucose levels can be measured. [[Blood glucose monitoring]] can be performed by multiple methods, such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in the blood after 8 hours of fasting. Another test is the 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) – for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done, then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink and is retested. This test measures the ability of the person's body to process glucose. Over time the blood glucose levels should decrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream.

===Hypoglycemia management===
[[File:Soluţie glucoză 5%.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Glucose, 5% solution for [[infusion]]s]]
Individuals with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] or other conditions that result in [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]] often carry small amounts of sugar in various forms. One sugar commonly used is glucose, often in the form of glucose tablets (glucose pressed into a tablet shape sometimes with one or more other ingredients as a binder), [[hard candy]], or [[sugar packet]].{{clear}}

In principle, cellulose could be hydrolyzed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical.<ref name="Ullmann" />

===Conversion to fructose===
{{main|isoglucose}}
In the USA almost exclusively corn (more precisely: corn syrup) is used as glucose source for the production of [[isoglucose]], which is a mixture of glucose and fructose, since fructose has a higher sweetening power — with same physiological calorific value of 374 kilocalories per 100 g. The annual world production of isoglucose is 8 million tonnes (as of 2011).<ref name="Ullmann 48" /> When made from corn syrup, the final product is [[high fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS).

Glucose is mainly used for the production of fructose and of glucose-containing foods. In foods, it is used as a sweetener, [[humectant]], to increase the [[volume]] and to create a softer [[mouthfeel]].<ref name="Fellows" /> 
Various sources of glucose, such as grape juice (for wine) or malt (for beer), are used for fermentation to ethanol during the production of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Most soft drinks in the US use [[High-fructose corn syrup|HFCS]]-55 (with a fructose content of 55% in the dry mass), while most other HFCS-sweetened foods in the US use HFCS-42 (with a fructose content of 42% in the dry mass).<ref name="fda2014">{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm324856.htm |title=High Fructose Corn Syrup: Questions and Answers |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |date=2014-11-05 |access-date=2017-12-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013538/https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm324856.htm |archive-date=2018-01-25}}</ref> In Mexico, on the other hand, soft drinks are sweetened by cane sugar, which has a higher sweetening power.<ref>Kevin Pang: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110629002034/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002076071_coke29.html ''Mexican Coke a hit in U.S.''] In: ''[[Seattle Times]]'', October 29, 2004.</ref> In addition, glucose syrup is used, inter alia, in the production of [[confectionery]] such as [[candy|candies]], [[toffee]] and [[fondant icing|fondant]].<ref name="Beckett">Steve T.

==Analysis==
When a glucose molecule is to be detected at a certain position in a larger molecule, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], [[X-ray crystallography]] analysis or [[lectin]] [[immunostaining]] is performed with [[concanavalin A]] reporter enzyme conjugate, which binds only glucose or mannose.

===Classical qualitative detection reactions===
These reactions have only historical significance:

====Fehling test====
The [[Fehling test]] is a classic method for the detection of aldoses.<ref name="Fehling-Harn">H. Fehling: ''Quantitative Bestimmung des Zuckers im Harn''. In: ''[[Archiv für physiologische Heilkunde]]'' (1848), volume 7, p.&nbsp;64–73 (in German).</ref> Due to mutarotation, glucose is always present to a small extent as an open-chain aldehyde. By adding the Fehling reagents (Fehling (I) solution and Fehling (II) solution), the aldehyde group is oxidized to a [[carboxylic acid]], while the Cu<sup>2+</sup> tartrate complex is reduced to Cu<sup>+</sup> and forms a brick red precipitate (Cu<sub>2</sub>O).

====Tollens test====
In the [[Tollens test]], after addition of ammoniacal [[Silver nitrate|AgNO<sub>3</sub>]] to the sample solution, glucose reduces Ag<sup>+</sup> to elemental [[silver]].<ref>B. Tollens: [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112025692838;view=1up;seq=535 ''Über ammon-alkalische Silberlösung als Reagens auf Aldehyd''].

Glucose and other monosaccharides rapidly produce a reddish color and reddish brown [[copper(I) oxide]] (Cu<sub>2</sub>O).

====Nylander's test====
As a reducing sugar, glucose reacts in the [[Nylander's test]].<ref>Emil Nylander: ''Über alkalische Wismuthlösung als Reagens auf Traubenzucker im Harne'', [[Zeitschrift für physiologische Chemie]]. Volume 8, Issue 3, 1884, p.&nbsp;175–185 [http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle/j$002fbchm1.1884.8.issue-3$002fbchm1.1884.8.3.175$002fbchm1.1884.8.3.175.xml Abstract]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213720/http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle/j$002fbchm1.1884.8.issue-3$002fbchm1.1884.8.3.175$002fbchm1.1884.8.3.175.xml |date=2015-09-23 }} (in German).</ref>

====Other tests====
Upon heating a dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] solution with glucose to 100&nbsp;°C, a strong reddish browning and a caramel-like odor develops.<ref name="Schwedt 102">Georg Schwedt: ''Zuckersüße Chemie''. John Wiley & Sons, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-527-66001-8}}, p.&nbsp;102 (in German).</ref> Concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] dissolves dry glucose without blackening at room temperature forming sugar sulfuric acid.<ref name="Schwedt 102" /> In a yeast solution, alcoholic fermentation produces carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2.0454 molecules of glucose to one molecule of [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]].<ref name="Schwedt 102" /> Glucose forms a black mass with [[stannous chloride]].<ref name="Schwedt 102" /> In an ammoniacal silver solution, glucose (as well as lactose and dextrin) leads to the deposition of silver. In an ammoniacal [[lead acetate]] solution, white [[lead glycoside]] is formed in the presence of glucose, which becomes less soluble on cooking and turns brown.<ref name="Schwedt 102" /> In an ammoniacal copper solution, yellow [[copper oxide]] hydrate is formed with glucose at room temperature, while red copper oxide is formed during boiling (same with dextrin, except for with an ammoniacal [[copper acetate]] solution).<ref name="Schwedt 102" /> With [[Picric acid|Hager's reagent]], glucose forms [[mercury oxide]] during boiling.<ref name="Schwedt 102" /> An alkaline [[bismuth]] solution is used to precipitate elemental, black-brown bismuth with glucose.<ref name="Schwedt 102" /> Glucose boiled in an [[ammonium molybdate]] solution turns the solution blue. A solution with [[indigo carmine]] and [[sodium carbonate]] destains when boiled with glucose.<ref name="Schwedt 102" />

===Instrumental quantification===
====Refractometry and polarimetry====
In concentrated solutions of glucose with a low proportion of other carbohydrates, its concentration can be determined with a polarimeter. For sugar mixtures, the concentration can be determined with a [[refractometer]], for example in the [[Oechsle scale|Oechsle]] determination in the course of the production of wine.

====Photometric enzymatic methods in solution====
{{main|Glucose oxidation reaction}}
The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) converts glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. Another enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes a chromogenic reaction (Trinder reaction)<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/000456326900600108 |title=Determination of Glucose in Blood Using Glucose Oxidase with an Alternative Oxygen Acceptor |journal=Annals of Clinical Biochemistry |volume=6 |pages=24–27 |year=1969 |last1=Trinder |first1=P. |s2cid=58131350 }}</ref> of [[phenol]] with [[4-Aminoantipyrine|4-aminoantipyrine]] to a purple dye.

====Photometric test-strip method====
The test-strip method employs the above-mentioned enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconic acid to form hydrogen peroxide. The reagents are immobilised on a polymer matrix, the so-called test strip, which assumes a more or less intense color. This can be measured reflectometrically at 510&nbsp;nm with the aid of an LED-based handheld photometer. This allows routine blood sugar determination by nonscientists. In addition to the reaction of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine, new chromogenic reactions have been developed that allow photometry at higher wavelengths (550&nbsp;nm, 750&nbsp;nm).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1039/A709038B |title=Water-soluble chromogenic reagent for colorimetric detection of hydrogen peroxide—an alternative to 4-aminoantipyrine working at a long wavelength |journal=Analytical Communications |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=71–74 |year=1998 |last1=Mizoguchi |first1=Makoto |last2=Ishiyama |first2=Munetaka |last3=Shiga |first3=Masanobu}}</ref>

====Amperometric glucose sensor====
The electroanalysis of glucose is also based on the enzymatic reaction mentioned above. The produced hydrogen peroxide can be amperometrically quantified by anodic oxidation at a potential of 600 mV.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid=18154363 |year=2008 |last1=Wang |first1=J. |title=Electrochemical glucose biosensors |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=814–825 |doi=10.1021/cr068123a}}.</ref> The GOx is immobilized on the electrode surface or in a membrane placed close to the electrode.

====Other sensory methods====
There are a variety of other chemical sensors for measuring glucose.<ref name="Borisov">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1021/cr068105t |pmid=18229952 |year=2008 |last1=Borisov |first1=S.

In addition to the organic boronic acid derivatives, which often bind highly specifically to the 1,2-diol groups of sugars, there are also other probe concepts classified by functional mechanisms which use selective glucose-binding proteins (e.g. concanavalin A) as a receptor. Furthermore, methods were developed which indirectly detect the glucose concentration via the concentration of metabolized products, e.g. by the consumption of oxygen using fluorescence-optical sensors.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0956-5663(99)00073-1 |pmid=10826645 |title=Sol–gel based glucose biosensors employing optical oxygen transducers, and a method for compensating for variable oxygen background |journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics |volume=15 |issue=1–2 |pages=69–76 |year=2000 |last1=Wolfbeis |first1=Otto S. |last2=Oehme |first2=Ines |last3=Papkovskaya |first3=Natalya |last4=Klimant |first4=Ingo}}</ref> Finally, there are enzyme-based concepts that use the intrinsic absorbance or fluorescence of (fluorescence-labeled) enzymes as reporters.<ref name="Borisov" />

====Copper iodometry====
Glucose can be quantified by copper iodometry.<ref name="Galant">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.04.071 |pmid=26041177 |year=2015 |last1=Galant |first1=A.

===Chromatographic methods===
In particular, for the analysis of complex mixtures containing glucose, e.g. in honey, chromatographic methods such as [[high performance liquid chromatography]] and [[gas chromatography]]<ref name="Galant" /> are often used in combination with [[mass spectrometry]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sanz | first1 = M.
