'''7 World Trade Center''' ('''7 WTC''', '''WTC-7''', or '''Tower 7''') refers to two buildings that have existed at the same location within the [[World Trade Center site]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. The original structure, part of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|original World Trade Center]], was completed in 1987 and was destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. The current structure opened in May 2006. Both buildings were developed by [[Larry Silverstein]], who holds a [[ground rent|ground lease]] for the site from the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]].

The original {{nowrap|7 World}} Trade Center was {{nowrap|47 stories}} tall, clad in red granite masonry, and occupied a [[trapezoid]]al footprint. An elevated walkway spanning [[Vesey Street]] connected the building to the World Trade Center plaza. The building was situated above a [[Consolidated Edison]] power substation, which imposed unique structural design constraints. When the building opened in 1987, Silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants. [[Salomon Brothers]] signed a long-term lease in 1988 and became the anchor tenant of {{Nowrap|7 WTC}}.

On September 11, 2001, the structure was substantially damaged by debris when the nearby North Tower of the World Trade Center [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapsed]]. The debris ignited fires on multiple lower floors of the building, which continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the afternoon. The building's internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires. The collapse began when a critical internal column buckled and triggered [[cascading failure]] of nearby columns throughout, which was first visible from the exterior with the crumbling of a rooftop penthouse structure at 5:20:33&nbsp;pm. This initiated [[progressive collapse]] of the entire building at {{nowrap|5:21:10 pm}}, according to [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]],<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|23}} while the 2008 NIST study placed the final collapse time at {{nowrap|5:20:52 pm}}.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|19, 21, 50–51}} The collapse made the old 7 World Trade Center the first steel skyscraper known to have collapsed primarily due to uncontrolled fires.<ref name="nist-questions" /><ref name="bbc20080704" />

Construction of the new {{nowrap|7 World}} Trade Center began in 2002 and was completed in 2006. The building is {{nowrap|52 stories}} tall (plus one underground floor), making it the 28th-tallest in New York.<ref name="skyscraperCenter" /><ref name="som" /><ref name="Silverstein Properties" /> It is built on a smaller footprint than the original, and is bounded by Greenwich, [[Vesey Street (Manhattan)|Vesey]], [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington]], and Barclay Streets on the east, south, west, and north, respectively. A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space that was part of the original building's footprint. The current building's design emphasizes safety, with a [[reinforced concrete]] core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing on steel columns. It also incorporates numerous [[Sustainable design|green design]] features. The building was the first commercial office building in New York City to receive the U.S. Green Building Council's [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certification, where it won a gold rating. It was also one of the first projects accepted to be part of the Council's pilot program for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design – Core and Shell Development (LEED-CS).<ref name="wZ43A" />

[[File:Wtc7 transfer trusses.png|thumb|left|300px|Transfer trusses used on the 5–7th floors to redistribute load to the foundation]]
The original 7&nbsp;World Trade Center was a 47-story building, designed by [[Emery Roth|Emery Roth & Sons]], with a red [[granite]] facade. The building was {{convert|610|ft|m}} tall, with a [[trapezoid]]al footprint that was {{convert|330|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|140|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name="NCSTAR 1-1-p13" /><ref name="emporis1" /> [[Tishman Realty & Construction]] managed construction of the building.<ref name="NCSTAR 1-1-p13" /> The ground-breaking ceremony was hosted on October 2, 1984.<ref name=":2" /> The building opened in May 1987, becoming the seventh structure of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].<ref name="59voH" />

7 World Trade Center was constructed above a two-story [[Consolidated Edison|Con Edison]] [[electrical substation|substation]] that had been located on the site since 1967.<ref name="NCSTAR 1-9-ch2" /><ref name=":2" /> The substation had a [[caisson (engineering)|caisson]] foundation designed to carry the weight of a future building of 25&nbsp;stories containing {{convert|600,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="salvarinas" /> The final design for 7&nbsp;World Trade Center was for a much larger building than originally planned when the substation was built.<ref name="03vhN" />{{rp|xxxviii}} The structural design of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center therefore included a system of gravity column transfer trusses and girders, located between floors&nbsp;5 and 7, to transfer loads to the smaller foundation.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|5}} Existing caissons installed in 1967 were used, along with new ones, to accommodate the building. The 5th floor functioned as a structural diaphragm, providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons. Above the 7th floor,  the building's structure was a typical [[Tube (structure)|tube-frame]] design, with columns in the core and on the perimeter, and lateral loads resisted by perimeter moment frames.<ref name="salvarinas" />

A shipping and receiving ramp, which served the entire World Trade Center complex, occupied the eastern quarter of the 7&nbsp;World Trade Center footprint. The building was open below the 3rd floor, providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp.<ref name="salvarinas" /> The spray-on [[fireproofing]] for structural steel elements was [[gypsum]]-based [[Monokote]], which had a two-hour fire rating for steel beams, girders and trusses, and a three-hour rating for columns.<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|11}}

Mechanical equipment was installed on floors four through seven, including 12&nbsp;[[transformer]]s on the 5th floor. Several [[Emergency power system|emergency generators]] installed in the building were used by the [[NYC Emergency Management|New York City Office of Emergency Management]], [[Salomon Brothers|Salomon Smith Barney]], and other tenants.<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|13}} In order to supply the generators, 24,000&nbsp;gallons (91,000&nbsp;L) of [[diesel fuel]] were stored below ground level.<ref name="hk1Ii" /> Diesel fuel distribution components were located at ground level, up to the ninth floor.<ref name="othlB" />{{rp|35}} After the [[World Trade Center 1993 bombings|World Trade Center bombings]] of February 26, 1993, New York City mayor [[Rudy Giuliani#Preparedness|Rudy Giuliani]] decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7&nbsp;World Trade Center. Although this decision was criticized in light of the events of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], the fuel in the building is today not believed to have contributed to the collapse of the building.<ref name="QTTaJ" /><ref name="NIST Advisory Committee Dec 2007" />{{rp|2}} The roof of the building included a small west penthouse and a larger east mechanical penthouse.<ref name="NCSTAR 1-9-ch2" />

Each floor had {{convert|47,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of rentable office space, which made the building's floor plans considerably larger than most office buildings in the city.<ref name="P80dF" /> In all, 7&nbsp;World Trade Center had {{convert|1,868,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of office space.<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|1}} Two pedestrian bridges connected the main World Trade Center complex, across Vesey Street, to the third floor of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center. The lobby of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center held three murals by artist [[Al Held]]: ''The Third Circle'', ''Pan North XII'', and ''Vorces VII''.<ref name="2oY0K" />

===Tenants===
[[Image:WTC Building Arrangement and Site Plan (building 7 highlighted).jpg|thumb|left|250px|The position of 7&nbsp;WTC in relation to the other WTC buildings before September 11, 2001]]

In June 1986, before construction was completed, developer [[Larry Silverstein]] signed [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] as a tenant to lease the entire 7&nbsp;World Trade Center building for $3&nbsp;billion over a term of 30&nbsp;years.<ref name="2QyUi" />
In December 1986, after the [[Ivan Boesky|Boesky]] [[insider trading|insider-trading]] scandal, Drexel Burnham Lambert canceled the lease, leaving Silverstein to find other tenants.<ref name="0mIGD" />
Spicer & Oppenheim agreed to lease 14&nbsp;percent of the space, but for more than a year, as [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] and other factors adversely affected the [[Lower Manhattan]] real estate market, Silverstein was unable to find tenants for the remaining space. By April 1988, he had lowered the rent and made other concessions.<ref name="W0lre" />

In November 1988, Salomon Brothers withdrew from plans to build a large new complex at [[Columbus Circle]] in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], instead agreeing to a 20-year lease for the top 19 floors of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center.<ref name="x8QNG" /> The building was extensively renovated in 1989 to accommodate Salomon Brothers, and 7&nbsp;World Trade Center alternatively became known as the Salomon Brothers building.<ref name="Salomonsolution" /> Most of the three existing floors were removed as tenants continued to occupy other stories, and more than 350&nbsp;tons (U.S.) of steel were added to construct three double-height trading floors. Nine diesel generators were installed on the 5th floor as part of a backup power station. "Essentially, Salomon is constructing a building within a building – and it's an occupied building, which complicates the situation", said a district manager of [[Silverstein Properties]].<ref name="Salomonsolution" /> According to Larry Silverstein, the unusual task was possible because it could allow "entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building's structural integrity, on the assumption that someone might need double-height floors."<ref name="Salomonsolution" />

At the time of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Salomon Smith Barney was by far the largest tenant in 7&nbsp;World Trade Center, occupying {{convert|1,202,900|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} (64&nbsp;percent of the building) which included floors 28–45.<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|2}}<ref name="tenants" /> Other major tenants included [[The Hartford|ITT Hartford Insurance Group]] (122,590&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/11,400&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>), [[American Express]] Bank International (106,117&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/9,900&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>), [[Standard Chartered Bank]] (111,398&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/10,350&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>), and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (106,117&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/9,850&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>).<ref name="tenants" /> Smaller tenants included the [[Internal Revenue Service]] Regional Council (90,430&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/8,400&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) and the [[United States Secret Service]] (85,343&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/7,900&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>).<ref name="tenants" /> The smallest tenants included the [[New York City Office of Emergency Management]],<ref name="R000978" /> [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]], [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] of New York, First State Management Group Inc., [[PNC Financial Services|Provident Financial Management]], and the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].<ref name="tenants" /> The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD) and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) shared the 25th floor with the IRS.<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|2}} (The clandestine CIA office was revealed only after the 9/11 attacks.)<ref name="RYPLi" />  Floors 46–47 were [[mechanical floor]]s, as were the bottom six floors and part of the seventh floor.<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|2}}<ref name="RYPLi" />

[[File:Wtc7onfire.jpg|thumb|7 World Trade Center on fire after the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse of the Twin Towers]] on [[September 11 attacks|9/11]]]]

====Collapse====
As the North Tower collapsed on September 11, 2001, heavy debris hit 7&nbsp;World Trade Center, damaging the south face of the building<ref name="NIST-june2004" />{{rp|18 (PDF p. 22)}} and starting fires that continued to burn throughout the afternoon.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|16, 18}} The collapse also caused damage to the southwest corner between floors 7 and 17 and on the south face between Floor 44 and the roof; other possible structural damage included a large vertical gash near the center of the south face between Floors 24 and 41.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|17}} The building was equipped with a [[Fire sprinkler system|sprinkler system]], but had many single-point vulnerabilities for failure: the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps, rather than being a fully automatic system; the floor-level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser, and the sprinkler system required some power for the [[fire pump]] to deliver water.<ref name="xe8mP" />{{rp|11}} Additionally, water pressure was low, with little or no water to feed sprinklers.<ref name="eQl3H" />{{Rp|23–30}}

After the North Tower collapsed, some firefighters entered 7&nbsp;World Trade Center to search the building. They attempted to extinguish small pockets of fire, but low water pressure hindered their efforts.<ref name="lr3En" /> Over the course of the day, fires burned out of control on several floors of 7 World Trade Center, the flames visible on the east side of the building.<ref name="4qq59" /> During the afternoon, the fire was also seen on floors 6–10, 13–14, 19–22, and 29–30.<ref name="NIST-june2004" />{{rp|24 (PDF p. 28)}} In particular, the fires on floors 7 through 9 and 11 through 13 continued to burn out of control during the afternoon.<ref name="nist-questions" /> At approximately 2:00&nbsp;pm, firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center between the 10th and 13th floors, a sign that the building was unstable and might collapse.<ref name="hayden" /> During the afternoon, firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building.<ref name="19xch" /> Around 3:30&nbsp;pm, FDNY Chief [[Daniel A. Nigro]] decided to halt rescue operations, surface removal, and searches along the surface of the debris near 7&nbsp;World Trade Center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel.<ref name="S0RDT" /> The fire expanded the girders of the building, causing some to lose their structural integrity. This led column number 79, a critical column supporting a large part of the 13th floor, to buckle, causing the floors above it to collapse to the fifth floor; however, this could not be seen from outside the building. The structure also developed cracks in the facade just before the entire building started to fall.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|21}}<ref name=":0" /> According to FEMA, this collapse started at 5:20:33&nbsp;pm EDT when the east mechanical penthouse started crumbling.<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|23}}<ref name=":1" /> Differing times are given as to what time the building completely collapsed:<ref name=":1" /> at 5:21:10&nbsp;pm EDT according to FEMA,<ref name="fema-ch5" />{{rp|23}} and at 5:20:52&nbsp;pm EDT according to NIST.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|19, 21, 50–51}} There were no [[casualty (person)|casualties]] associated with the collapse.<ref name=":0" /> NIST found no evidence to support [[World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories#7 World Trade Center|conspiracy theories]] such as the collapse being the result of explosives; it found that a combination of factors including physical damage, fire, and the building's unusual construction set off a chain-reaction collapse.<ref name="2OBAX" />

====Reports====
[[File:Wtc7 collapse progression.png|thumb|left|250px|Schematic view of collapse progression, with structural failure initiating on lower floors, on the east side of the building and vertical progression up to the east mechanical penthouse]]

In May 2002, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the Structural Engineering Institute of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] under the leadership of Dr. [[W. Gene Corley]], P.E. FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1&nbsp;WTC and 2&nbsp;WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued burning unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting. The report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation.<ref name="NIST Advisory Committee Dec 2007" />{{rp|3}}

Subsequently, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) [[National Construction Safety Team Act|was authorized]] to lead an investigation into the structural failure and [[collapse of the World Trade Center]] Twin Towers and 7&nbsp;World Trade Center.<ref name="nist-questions" /> The investigation, led by Dr S. Shyam Sunder, drew upon in-house technical expertise as well as the knowledge of several outside private institutions, including the Structural Engineering Institute of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (SEI/ASCE); the [[Society of Fire Protection Engineers]] (SFPE); the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA); the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC); the [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] (CTBUH); and the [[National Council of Structural Engineers Associations|Structural Engineers Association of New York]] (SEAoNY).<ref name="T1eaX" />

[[File:Abcnews-wtc7damage.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Few photos and video clips exist that show the damage sustained to the south face of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center on 9/11. An [[ABC News]] helicopter captured footage of the south face of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center, including a glimpse of a gash, extending approximately 10 stories.]]

The bulk of the investigation of 7 World Trade Center was delayed until after reports were completed on the Twin Towers.<ref name="nist-questions" /> In the meantime, NIST provided a preliminary report about 7 WTC in June 2004, and thereafter released occasional updates on the investigation.<ref name="NIST-june2004" /> According to NIST, the investigation of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center was delayed for a number of reasons, including that NIST staff who had been working on 7&nbsp;World Trade Center were assigned full-time from June 2004 to September 2005 to work on the investigation of the collapse of the Twin Towers.<ref name="NISTFAQ" /> In June 2007, Shyam Sunder explained, <blockquote>We are proceeding as quickly as possible while rigorously testing and evaluating a wide range of scenarios to reach the most definitive conclusion possible. The 7&nbsp;WTC investigation is in some respects just as challenging, if not more so than the study of the towers. However, the current study does benefit greatly from the significant technological advances achieved and lessons learned from our work on the towers.<ref name="NIST7STAT1" /></blockquote>

[[File:Fiterman hall damage.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Borough of Manhattan Community College|BMCC]]'s [[Fiterman Hall]] was heavily damaged from the collapse of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center.]]

In November 2008, NIST released its final report on the causes of the collapse of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center.<ref name="ncstar1-a" /> This followed NIST's August 21, 2008, draft report which included a period for public comments,<ref name="nist-questions" /> and was followed in 2012 by a peer-reviewed summary in the ''[[Journal of Structural Engineering]]''.<ref name="Rbfbr" /> In its investigation, NIST utilized [[ANSYS]] to model events leading up to collapse initiation and [[LS-DYNA]] models to simulate the global response to the initiating events.<ref name="ZsGBe" />{{rp|6–7}} NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers or the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs). The lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, column 79 buckled – pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall down as a single unit. The fires, which were fueled by office contents and burned for 7 hours, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|21–22}} At the time, this made the old 7 WTC the only steel skyscraper to have collapsed from fire.<ref name="bbc20080704" />

When 7&nbsp;WTC collapsed, debris caused substantial damage and contamination to the [[Borough of Manhattan Community College]]'s [[Fiterman Hall]] building, located adjacent at 30&nbsp;West Broadway, to the extent that the building was not salvageable.<ref name="pvpL2" /> A revised plan called for demolition in 2009 and completion of the new Fiterman Hall in 2012, at a cost of $325&nbsp;million.<ref name="WXVcB" /> The [[Verizon Building]], an [[art deco]] building located directly to the west, had extensive damage to its eastern facade from the collapse of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center, though it was later restored at a cost of US$1.4&nbsp;billion.<ref name="nyconstruction" />

[[File:WTC Area With Building Numbers 50dpi contrast.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of WTC remains and neighboring buildings on September 23, 2001, with the original footprints of the Twin Towers and 7 WTC outlined]]

Files relating to numerous federal investigations had been housed in 7 World Trade Center. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] estimated over 10,000 of its cases were affected.<ref name="NYLEq" /> Investigative files in the Secret Service's largest field office were lost, with one Secret Service agent saying, "All the evidence that we stored at 7 World Trade, in all our cases, went down with the building."<ref name="TTV" /> Copies of emails in connection with the [[WorldCom scandal]] that were later requested by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] from [[Salomon Brothers]], a subsidiary of [[Citigroup]] housed in the building, were also destroyed.<ref name="street" />

The NIST report found no evidence supporting the conspiracy theories that 7 World Trade Center was brought down by controlled demolition. Specifically, the window breakage pattern and blast sounds that would have resulted from the use of explosives were not observed.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|26–28}} The suggestion that an incendiary material such as [[thermite]] was used instead of explosives was considered unlikely by NIST because of the building's structural response to the fire, the nature of the fire, and the unlikelihood that a sufficient amount of thermite could be planted without discovery.<ref name="nist-questions" /> Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the Twin Towers.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|63–73}} It urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable;<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|65–66}} and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|65, 69}}  Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse, the main point of NIST's recommendations was that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable.<ref name="ncstar1-a" />{{rp|63–73}}

}}
{{New World Trade Center}}

The new 7&nbsp;World Trade Center has 52&nbsp;stories and is {{convert|741|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall.<ref name="Txdhz" /> The building has 42&nbsp;floors of leasable space, starting at the 11th floor, and a total of {{convert|1.7|e6sqft|m2|abbr=unit}} of office space.<ref name="emporis2" /> The first ten floors house an electrical substation which provides power to much of Lower Manhattan. The office tower has a narrower footprint at ground level than did its predecessor, so the course of Greenwich Street could be restored to reunite [[TriBeCa]] and the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]]. The original building, on the other hand, had bordered West Broadway on the east, necessitating the destruction of Greenwich Street between Barclay Street and the northern border of the World Trade Center superblock.<ref name="nyt-20020411" />

===Design===

[[David Childs]] of [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] worked in conjunction with glass artist and designer James Carpenter to create a design that uses ultra-clear, low-iron glass to provide reflectivity and light, with stainless-steel [[spandrel]]s behind the glass to help reflect sunlight.<ref name="ar-June2006" /> Stainless steel used in the building façade is [[molybdenum]]-containing Type&nbsp;316, which provides improved resistance to corrosion.<ref name="h5SJY" /> To enclose the power substation and improve its aesthetics, the base of the building has a curtain wall with [[stainless steel]] [[louver]]s that provide ventilation for the machinery.<ref name="SvPR3" /> During the day, the curtain wall reflects light, while at night it is illuminated with blue [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lights.<ref name="sOSZj" /> The curtain wall around the lobby uses heavily laminated, heat-strengthened glass that meets high standards for blast resistance.<ref name="FT0vg" /> At night, a large cube of light above the lobby also emanates blue light, while during the day it provides white light to the lobby, and at dusk, it transitions to violet and back to blue.<ref name="LXUcR" /> Inside the main lobby, artist [[Jenny Holzer]] created a large light installation with glowing text moving across wide plastic panels.<ref name="ar-June2006" /> The entire wall, which is {{convert|65|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, changes color according to the time of day. Holzer worked with Klara Silverstein, the wife of Larry Silverstein, to select poetry for the art installation. The wall is structurally fortified as a security measure.<ref name="UHsLh" />

The building is being promoted as the safest skyscraper in the U.S.<ref name="lower" /> According to Silverstein Properties, the owner of the building, it "incorporate[s] a host of life-safety enhancements that will become the prototype for new high-rise construction."<ref name="NjgTl" /> The building has {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} [[reinforced concrete|reinforced-concrete]] and [[fireproofing|fireproofed]] elevator and stairway access shafts. The original building used only [[drywall]] to line these shafts.<ref name="reiss" /> The stairways are wider than in the original building to permit faster egress.<ref name="reiss" />

7 World Trade Center is equipped with [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis]] [[Destination control system|destination elevators]].<ref name="Ym4Gt" /> After pressing a destination floor number on a lobby keypad, passengers are grouped and directed to specific elevators that will stop at the selected floor (there are no buttons to press inside the elevators). This system is designed to reduce elevator waiting and travel times. The elevator system is integrated with the lobby turnstile and card reader system that identifies the floor on which a person works as he or she enters and can automatically call the elevator for that floor.<ref name="07aQD" />

Nearly 30 percent of structural steel used in the building consists of recycled steel.<ref name="VVJY5" /> Rainwater is collected and used for irrigation of the park and to cool the building.<ref name="ar-June2006" /> Along with other sustainable design features, the building is designed to allow in plenty of natural light, power is metered to tenants to encourage them to conserve energy, the heating steam is reused to generate some power for the building, and recycled materials are used for insulation and interior materials.<ref name="5S8ti" />

===Construction===
[[File:Construction 7wtc.jpg|thumb|200px|right|7 World Trade Center construction in October 2004]]
The construction phase of the new 7 World Trade Center began on May 7, 2002, with the installation of a fence around the construction site.<ref name="nyt-7wtcstart" /> Tishman Construction Corporation of New York began work at the new 7&nbsp;World Trade Center in 2002, soon after the site was cleared of debris. Restoring the Con Ed [[electrical substation]] was an urgent priority to meet power demands of Lower Manhattan.<ref name="nyt-20020411" /> Because 7&nbsp;World Trade Center is separate from the main {{convert|16|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[World Trade Center site]], [[Larry Silverstein]] required approval from only the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]], and rebuilding was able to proceed quickly.<ref name="zRVfI" /> Building Seven was not included in the original World Trade Center master plan by [[Daniel Libeskind]], but was designed by [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill|Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] under the leadership of [[David Childs]], who largely redesigned [[One World Trade Center]].

Once construction of the power substation was completed in October 2003, work proceeded on building the office tower. An unusual approach was used in constructing the building; erecting the steel frame before adding the concrete core. This approach allowed the construction schedule to be shortened by a few months.<ref name="0pjsf" /> Construction was completed in 2006 at a cost of $700&nbsp;million.<ref name="ar-June2006" /> Though Silverstein received $861&nbsp;million from insurance on the old building, he owed more than $400&nbsp;million on its mortgage.<ref name="s21tj" /> Costs to rebuild were covered by $475&nbsp;million in [[Liberty bond|Liberty Bonds]], which provide tax-exempt financing to help stimulate rebuilding in Lower Manhattan and insurance money that remained after other expenses.<ref name="eAXxQ" />

A {{convert|15,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} triangular park was created between the extended Greenwich Street and West Broadway by David Childs with Ken Smith and his colleague, Annie Weinmayr, of Ken Smith Landscape Architect. The park comprises an open central plaza with a fountain and flanking groves of [[Liquidambar|sweetgum]] trees and [[Buxus|boxwood]] shrubs.<ref name="xNreh" /> At the center of the fountain, sculptor [[Jeff Koons]] created ''Balloon Flower (Red)'', whose mirror-polished stainless steel represents a twisted balloon in the shape of a flower.<ref name="X73Me" />

===Opening===
The building was officially opened at noon on May 23, 2006, with a free concert featuring [[Suzanne Vega]], [[Citizen Cope]], Bill Ware Vibes, [[Brazilian Girls]], [[Ollabelle]], [[Pharaoh's Daughter]], [[Ronan Tynan]] (of the [[Irish Tenors]]), and special guest [[Lou Reed]].<ref name="ZiBOm" /><ref name="WaPo-7WTCOpens-2006" /> Prior to opening, in March 2006, the new 7&nbsp;World Trade Center frontage and lobby were used in scenes for the movie ''[[Perfect Stranger (film)|Perfect Stranger]]'' with [[Halle Berry]] and [[Bruce Willis]].<ref name="ahqQ4" />

Since the building opened, several unleased upper floors have been used for events such as charity lunches, fashion shows, and black-tie galas. Silverstein Properties allowed space in the new building to be used for these events as a means to draw people to see the building.<ref name="0MmmY" /> From September 8 to October 7, 2006, the work of photographer Jonathan Hyman was displayed in "An American Landscape", a free exhibit hosted by the [[National September 11 Memorial & Museum|World Trade Center Memorial Foundation]] at 7&nbsp;World Trade Center. The photographs captured the response of people in New York City and across the United States after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The exhibit took place on the 45th floor while space remained available for lease.<ref name="LHRnP" />

[[File:Nyas lobby wtc7.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[New York Academy of Sciences]] office (lobby) on the 40th floor]]

By March 2007, 60&nbsp;percent of the building had been leased.<ref name="dYZDT" /> In September 2006, [[Moody's]] signed a 20-year lease to rent 15&nbsp;floors of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center.<ref name="7V7gR" /> Other tenants that had signed leases in 7&nbsp;World Trade Center, as of May 2007, included [[ABN AMRO]],<ref name="XB9pB" /> [[Ameriprise Financial]] Inc.,<ref name="9TZHT" /><ref name="WaPo-7WTCOpens-2006" /> law firm [[WilmerHale]], Darby & Darby P.C.,<ref name="9AQIr" /> Mansueto Ventures LLC, business publisher of [[Fast Company (magazine)|''Fast Company'']] and [[Inc. (magazine)|''Inc.'']],<ref name="NlY6L" /> and the [[New York Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="1Fkl2" /><ref name="WaPo-7WTCOpens-2006" />

The space occupied by [[Mansueto Ventures]] has been designed to use the maximum amount of natural light and has an open floor plan.<ref name="fZZND" /> The space used by the New York Academy of Sciences on the 40th floor, designed by H<sup>3</sup> Hardy Collaboration Architecture, works with the [[parallelogram]] shape of the building. Keeping with the green design of the building, the NYAS uses recycled materials in many of the office furnishings, has zoned heating and cooling, and [[Motion detector|motion-detecting]] lights, which activate automatically when people are present, and adjust according to incoming sunlight.<ref name="Fhtx9" />

[[Silverstein Properties]] also has offices and the Silver Suites executive office suites<ref name="LOoIJ" /> in 7 World Trade Center, along with office space used by the architectural and engineering firms working on [[1 World Trade Center]], [[150 Greenwich Street]], [[175 Greenwich Street]], and [[200 Greenwich Street]].<ref name="Vn4BR" /> The building became fully leased in September 2011 when [[MSCI]] was reported to have leased a {{convert|125,000|sqft|m2}} space on the top floor.<ref name="PxId6" />
