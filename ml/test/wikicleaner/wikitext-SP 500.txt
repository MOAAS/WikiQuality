The '''Standard and Poor's 500''', or simply the '''S&P 500''',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/SandP-500|title=S&P 500|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref> is a [[stock market index]] tracking the performance of 500 large companies listed on [[stock exchange]]s in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices. As of December 31, 2020, more than $5.4 trillion was invested in assets tied to the performance of the index.<ref name=sp500r>{{cite web | url=https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500 | title=S&P 500® | publisher=[[S&P Global]]}}</ref>

The S&P 500 index is a free-float weighted/[[capitalization-weighted index]]. As of September 30, 2021, the nine largest companies on the [[list of S&P 500 companies]] accounted for 28.1% of the market capitalization of the index and were, in order of weighting, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Microsoft]], [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet]] (including both class A & C shares), [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]], [[Meta Platforms]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[Nvidia]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]] and [[JPMorgan Chase]].<ref name=sp500sheet/> The components that have increased their dividends in 25 consecutive years are known as the [[S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Lichtenfeld | first=M. | title=Get Rich with Dividends: A Proven System for Earning Double-Digit Returns | location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] | publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]] | year=2012 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESsbb7oCS2YC&pg=PT25 | page=25| isbn=9781118282342 }}</ref>{{rp|25}}

==Investing in the S&P 500==
===Mutual and exchange-traded funds===
[[Index fund]]s, including [[mutual fund]]s and [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), can replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of the index by holding the same stocks as the index in the same proportions. ETFs that replicate the performance of the index are issued by [[The Vanguard Group]] ({{NYSE Arca|VOO}}), [[iShares]] ({{NYSE Arca|IVV}}), and [[State Street Corporation]] ({{NYSE Arca|SPY}}), and the most liquid based on average daily volume is currently ({{NYSE Arca|SPY}}), although SPY has a slightly higher expense ratio of 0.09% compared to just 0.03% for VOO and IVV. Mutual funds that track the index are offered by [[Fidelity Investments]], [[T. Rowe Price]], and [[Charles Schwab Corporation]].<ref name=track>{{Cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/investing/top-sp-500-etfs/ | title=Top 3 ETFs to Track the S&P 500 | last=Olson | first=Sheila | website=[[Investopedia]] | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324084704/https://www.investopedia.com/investing/top-sp-500-etfs/ | archive-date=March 24, 2019|url-status=live | df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.usnews.com/investing/funds/slideshows/s-p-index-funds-to-buy-now | title=7 S&P Index Funds to Buy Now | first=Ellen | last=Chang | work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] | date=June 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.thebalance.com/best-sandp-500-index-funds-2466399 | title=The Best S&P 500 Index Funds | first=KENT | last=THUNE | work=TheBalance | date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>

===Derivatives===
In the [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] market, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (CME) offers [[futures contract]]s that track the index and trade on the exchange floor in an [[open outcry]] auction, or on CME's Globex platform, and are the exchange's most popular product. Ticker symbols are:
* /SP for the full-sized contract 
* /ES for the [[E-mini S&P]] contract that is one fifth the size of /SP
* /MES for the [[E-micro|''Micro'']] E-mini futures contract that is one tenth the size of the S&P E-mini contract, i.e. 1/50 the size of the full-sized (SP) contract

The [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] (CBOE) offers [[Option (finance)|options]] on the S&P 500 index as well as on S&P 500 index ETFs, inverse ETFs, and leveraged ETFs.

==History==
In 1860, [[Henry Varnum Poor]] formed Poor's Publishing, which published an investor's guide to the railroad industry.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=https://www.spglobal.com/en/who-we-are/our-history | title=Our History | publisher=[[S&P Global]]}}</ref>

In 1923, Standard Statistics Company (founded in 1906 as the [[S&P Global Ratings#History|Standard Statistics Bureau]]) began rating mortgage bonds<ref name=history/> and developed its first stock market index consisting of the stocks of 233 U.S. companies, computed weekly.<ref name=keydates>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-sp-timeline-idUSBRE9450WL20130506 | title=Key dates and milestones in the S&P 500's history | first=Caroline | last=Valetkevitch | work=[[Reuters]] | date=May 6, 2013}}</ref>

In 1926, it developed a 90-stock index, computed daily.<ref name=keydates/>

In 1941, Poor's Publishing merged with Standard Statistics Company to form [[Standard & Poor's]].<ref name=history/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Standard & Poor's | encyclopedia=Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History | volume=3 | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] | editor-last=Riggs | editor-first=Thomas | date=2015 | page=1256 | id={{gale|CX3611000855}}}}</ref>

On Monday, March 4, 1957, the index was expanded to its current 500 companies and was renamed the S&P 500 Stock Composite Index.<ref name=keydates/>

In 1962, Ultronic Systems became the compiler of the S&P indices including the S&P 500 Stock Composite Index, the 425 Stock Industrial Index, the 50 Stock Utility Index, and the 25 Stock Rail Index.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/06/04/archives/vast-stock-wire-network-being-extended-to-coast.html | title=Vast stock wire network being extended to coast | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 4, 1962 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

On August 31, 1976, [[The Vanguard Group]] offered the first [[mutual fund]] to retail investors that tracked the index.<ref name=keydates/>

On April 21, 1982, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] began trading futures based on the index.<ref name=keydates/>

On July 1, 1983, [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] began trading [[Option (finance)|options]] based on the index.<ref name=keydates/>

Beginning in 1986, the index value was updated every 15 seconds, or 1,559 times per trading day, with price updates disseminated by [[Reuters]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/19/06/13915807/this-day-in-market-history-s-p-500-quotes-delivered-every-15-seconds | title=This Day In Market History: S&P 500 Quotes Delivered Every 15 Seconds | first=Wayne | last=Duggan | work=Benzinga | date=June 13, 2019}}</ref>

On January 22, 1993, the Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts [[exchange-traded fund]] issued by [[State Street Corporation]] began trading.<ref name=keydates/>

On September 9, 1997, [[CME Group]] introduced the S&P E-mini futures contract.<ref name=keydates/>

In 2005, the index transitioned to a public float-adjusted capitalization-weighting.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/standard-and-poors-announces-changes-to-us-investable-weight-factors-and-final-f/ | title=Standard & Poor's Announces Changes to U.S. Investable Weight Factors and Final Float Transition Schedule | date=March 9, 2005}}</ref>

==Selection criteria==
Like other indices managed by [[S&P Dow Jones Indices]], but unlike indices such as the [[Russell 1000 Index]] which are strictly rule-based, the components of the S&P 500 index are selected by a committee.  When considering the eligibility of a new addition, the committee assesses the company's merit using eight primary criteria: [[market capitalization]], [[Market liquidity|liquidity]], [[Domicile (law)|domicile]], [[public float]], [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] and representation of the industries in the [[economy of the United States]], financial viability, length of time publicly traded, and [[stock exchange]]. Over the past few years, there has been a decline in the number of S&P 500 companies with classified boards.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1=Bebchuk| first1=Lucian A. |last2=Hirst |first2=Scott| last3=Rhee| first3=June| date=2014-02-01| title=Towards the Declassification of S&P 500 Boards |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2400652 |location=Rochester, NY| ssrn=2400652 }}</ref>'''{{rp|159}}''' Requirements to be added to the index include:<ref name=S&P500Methodology/>

# Securities that are ineligible for inclusion in the index are [[limited partnership]]s, [[master limited partnership]]s and their [[investment trust]] units, [[OTC Bulletin Board]] issues, [[closed-end fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[Exchange-traded note]]s, [[royalty trust]]s, [[tracking stock]]s, [[preferred stock]], [[unit trust]]s, [[Warrant (finance)|equity warrants]], [[convertible bond]]s, [[investment trust]]s, [[American depositary receipt]]s, and [[American depositary share]]s.<ref name=S&P500Methodology/>
# Since 2017, companies with dual share classes are not added to the index.

The market cap eligibility criteria are for addition to an index, not for continued membership. As a result, an index constituent that appears to violate criteria for addition to that index is not removed unless ongoing conditions warrant an index change.<ref name="sp202200304"/>

A stock may rise in value when it is added to the index since [[index fund]]s must purchase that stock to continue tracking the index.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/w19290.html | title=Stock Price Reactions to Index Inclusion | first=Jay | last=Fitzgerald | publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/krantz/2013/07/05/stocks-soar-added-sp-500/2447185/ | title=Do stocks soar if they get into the S&P 500? | first=Matt | last=Krantz | work=[[USA TODAY]] | date=July 5, 2013}}</ref>

In October 2021, [[Bloomberg News]] reported that a study alleged that some companies purchase ratings from [[S&P Global]] to increase their chances of entering the S&P 500 Index—even without meeting the full criteria for inclusion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/new-nber-study-asks-whether-s-p-500-membership-is-up-for-sale |title=S&P 500 Membership May Be ‘For Sale,’ NBER Research Suggests |work=Bloomberg |last=Lee |first=Justina |date=October 12, 2021 |access-date=January 21, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Index value calculation==
The index is a free-float [[capitalization-weighted index]];<ref>{{cite book | author-link=Robert Fernholz | last=Fernholz | first=E. Robert | title=Stochastic Portfolio Theory | location=[[Berlin]]/[[Heidelberg]] | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] | date=April 17, 2013 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQDqBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA150 | page=150| isbn=9781475736991 }}</ref>{{rp|150}} that is, companies are weighted in the index in proportion to their [[market capitalization]]s. For purposes of determining the market capitalization of a company for weighting in the index, only the number of shares available for public trading ("[[public float]]") is used; shares held by insiders or controlling shareholders that are not publicly traded are excluded from the calculation.

The formula to calculate the S&P 500 index value is
:<math> \text{Index Level} = {\sum \left({P_i} \cdot {Q_i}\right) \over Divisor}</math>
where <math>P_i</math> is the price of the i-th stock in the index, <math>Q_i</math> is the corresponding number of shares publicly available ("float") for that stock, and <math>Divisor</math> is a normalization factor.

The <math>Divisor</math>, currently below 8.3 billion,<ref>{{cite web | title=Stock Market Indicators: S&P 500/400/600 Divisors | url=https://www.yardeni.com/pub/spdivisors.pdf | publisher=Yardeni}}</ref> is a number that is adjusted to keep the value of the index consistent despite [[corporate action]]s that affect market capitalization and would otherwise affect the calculation formula, such as additional share issuance, share buybacks, special [[dividend]]s, constituent changes, rights offerings, and [[corporate spin-off]]s. Stock splits do not affect the divisor since they do not affect market capitalization.<ref name=S&P500Methodology/> When a company is dropped and replaced by another with a different market capitalization, the divisor needs to be adjusted in such a way that the value of the S&P 500 index remains constant. All divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the closing value of the S&P 500 index.<ref>{{cite book | last=Shilling | first=Henry | title=The International Guide to Securities Market Indices | location=[[Chicago]] | publisher=[[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers]] | date=1996 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fhADwAAQBAJ&pg=PT290 | page=290| isbn=9781351343947 }}</ref>{{rp|290}}
