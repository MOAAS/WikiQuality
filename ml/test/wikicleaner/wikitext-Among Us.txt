'''''Among Us'''''{{Efn|When discussing its planned sequel, the game was given the [[retronym]] of '''''Among Us 1''''' by the game's developers as well as several news outlets.<ref name="sequelannouncement"/><ref name="gamerantsequel"/><ref name="techraptorsequel"/><ref name="sequelsomag"/>|name=|group=}} is a 2018 [[online multiplayer]] [[social deduction game]] developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. The game was inspired by the party game ''[[Mafia (party game)|Mafia]]'' and the science fiction horror film ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''. The game allows for [[cross-platform play]], first being released on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in June 2018 and on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] later that year in November. The game was then ported to the [[Nintendo Switch]] in December 2020, and on [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation 5]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Xbox Series X/S]] in December 2021. While the game was initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] [[Online streamer|streamers]] and [[YouTuber]]s playing it. A separate VR version of the game, ''Among Us VR'', will be released for  [[Meta Quest 2|Quest 2]], [[SteamVR]], and [[PlayStation VR]], developed by [[Schell Games]].

''Among Us'' takes place in a [[Science fiction|space-themed]] setting where players look like colorful armless cartoon [[astronauts]]; however, since the release of "The Skeld" [[Spacecraft|spaceship]], three other maps have been added in later years: the skyscraper "MIRA HQ", the "Polus" planetary station, and "The [[Airship]]" (based on ''Infiltrating the Airship'' from the ''Henry Stickmin'' series, also developed by Innersloth). Each player takes on one of two roles—most are ''Crewmates'', but a small number play ''Impostors''—which does not alter their appearance.{{Efn|The game uses the spelling "Impostor" rather than "Imposter" (though both are correct).<ref>{{cite web |last1=King |first1=Austin |title=Among Us Impostor vs. Imposter: Why InnerSloth Spells It Different |url=https://screenrant.com/among-us-impostor-imposter-innersloth-spelling-different-why/ |website=ScreenRant |access-date=April 9, 2021 |date=January 18, 2021}}</ref>}} The goal of the Crewmates is to either identify and vote out the Impostors, or to complete all the tasks around the map; the goal of the Impostors is to covertly sabotage the mission either by killing the Crewmates before they complete all their tasks or by triggering a disaster that cannot be resolved.

The Impostor(s) win(s) one of two ways: either by killing most of the crew (to the point that they're equal in number) or by sabotaging a critical system on the map (provided the Crewmates don't resolve it in time). The Crewmates likewise can win one of two ways: either by completing all tasks or by identifying and ejecting all Impostors.<ref name=":6" /> Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition (if a Crewmate quits the game, their tasks are automatically considered completed).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Duckworth|first=Joshua|date=October 8, 2020|title=Among Us: 5 Quality of Life Improvements The Game Needs|url=https://gamerant.com/among-us-5-imposter-ghosts-penalties-cheating-quality-life-improvements/|access-date=October 18, 2020|website=Game Rant|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Mc|first=Chris|date=October 2, 2020|title=How to Find the Impostor in Among Us|url=https://www.gamespew.com/2020/10/eighteen-tips-for-beating-the-impostor-in-among-us/|access-date=October 18, 2020|website=GameSpew|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=":2" /><!-- abilities -->

At the start of the game, Crewmates are assigned "tasks" to complete around the map (in the form of [[minigame]]s, [[Puzzle|minipuzzles]], and simple toggles), mostly consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data.<ref name=":1" /> Impostors are given a fake list of suggested tasks to blend in with Crewmates. However, they cannot legitimately perform tasks and can only pretend to be doing any of the tasks on the ship. Impostors, however, can sabotage vital systems (such as The Skeld's oxygen supply), close the doors to rooms, quickly and covertly travel through the ventilation system (commonly referred to as "venting"), and kill Crewmates when standing near them. To help the Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various [[surveillance system]]s on each map, such as [[security cameras]] and an [[System administrator|admin]] system on The Skeld,<ref name=":20" /> a doorlog system with sensors in MIRA HQ,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stella|first=Marloes|date=September 25, 2020|title=Among Us Guide: tips to winning as Crewmates|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/guide-tips|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200927151252/https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/guide-tips|archive-date=September 27, 2020|access-date=September 26, 2020|website=[[PCGamesN]]|language=en-GB}}</ref> and a vitals indicator in Polus.<ref name=":6" /> Crewmates may also confirm their identity through "visual tasks" (tasks that have animations which play for other players), which cannot be faked by Impostors.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Meluso|first=Maria|date=October 20, 2020|title=Every Visible Task in Among Us (& How They Work)|url=https://screenrant.com/every-visible-task-among-us-how-to-complete/|access-date=November 8, 2020|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US}}</ref>
<!-- ghosts -->

If a Crewmate is killed or any player is voted out and ejected, they become a ghost. Ghosts can pass through walls, watch other players' activities, and see and chat with other ghosts.<ref name=":2" /> Living players have a [[Fog of war#In video games|limited cone of vision]];<ref name=":5" /> ghosts do not.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Paez|first=Danny|title=3 'Among Us' ghost tips to help your team win from beyond the grave|url=https://www.inverse.com/gaming/among-us-ghost-tips-how-to-win-crewmate-imposter-ejection|access-date=September 16, 2020|website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|language=en|archive-date=September 21, 2020|date=September 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921123215/https://www.inverse.com/gaming/among-us-ghost-tips-how-to-win-crewmate-imposter-ejection|url-status=live}}</ref> Moreover, ghosts cannot communicate with living players or be seen by them. Ghosts help their living teammates by completing their tasks (as a Crewmate) or performing various acts of sabotage (as an Impostor).<ref name=":6" />
<!-- meetings -->

Any living player may call a group meeting by reporting a dead body, or by pressing the Emergency Meeting button on the map at any time (except during major sabotages, when Emergency Meetings cannot be called, but dead bodies can still be reported).<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Marshall|first=Cass|date=September 18, 2020|title=New Among Us players keep accidentally outing themselves as aliens|url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/9/18/21445675/among-us-community-memes-new-players-accidental-guilt|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921123249/https://www.polygon.com/2020/9/18/21445675/among-us-community-memes-new-players-accidental-guilt|archive-date=September 21, 2020|access-date=September 19, 2020|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|language=en}}</ref> During a meeting, players discuss who they believe is an Impostor based on the available [[evidence]]. Impostors can be identified beyond all [[reasonable doubt]] if they are seen ''venting'' or ''killing''. A player may be suspected for many other reasons though. However, all the players form a sort of [[jury]] and must weigh the veracity or value of each other's statements and questions during the meeting. A [[plurality vote]] is held, and if a plurality is obtained, the player whom the most crewmates voted is ejected from the map and they become a ghost, unless the majority of the crewmates choose to skip vote or there is a tie vote.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Players can communicate in a built-in [[Online chat|text chat]] (with some predefined phrases for phone users),<ref name=":1" /> but only during meetings, and only if they are alive (though ghosts can speak with one another at any time).<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":5" /> While the game does not have a built-in [[Voice chat in online gaming|voice chat]] system, it is common for players to use external programs such as [[Discord (software)|Discord]],<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10" /> or to converse regularly if they are in close physical proximity to one another. In case players can hear each other's voices, the game reminds them to not speak except during meetings.

In November 2021, additional roles were made available to players extending beyond the standard Crewmate or Impostor roles. Crewmates can also be Engineers, Scientists, or Guardian Angels. Engineers allow Crewmates to travel through vents like Impostors can, albeit to a limited capacity. Scientists can check vitals at any time to see if any player has been killed recently. Crewmates who become Ghosts can become Guardian Angels, which can temporarily protect living players from being killed. Impostors likewise can be Shapeshifters, allowing them to temporarily morph into other players. 
<!-- customizable options -->

In each game's lobby, various options can be adjusted to customize aspects of gameplay, such as player movement speed, the allowed number of emergency meetings, number of tasks, if there will be "visual tasks",<ref name=":4" /> or whether or not an Impostor is revealed after being voted off.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Garst|first=Aron|title=Playing "Among Us?"

''Among Us'' was inspired by the live [[party game]] [[Mafia (party game)|''Mafia'']],<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":16" /> and the [[science fiction horror]] film [[The Thing (1982 film)|''The Thing'']].<ref name=":33">{{Cite web|last=Fischer|first=Tyler|date=January 9, 2021|title=Original Among Us Was a Much Different and More Stressful Game|url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/among-us-game-original/|access-date=February 1, 2021|website=Comicbook|language=en}}</ref> The idea for the concept was originally given by Marcus Bromander, co-founder of Innersloth, who had played ''Mafia'' since he was a kid. In the original game, function cards were dealt and players wandered around a house, aimlessly, while another person secretly killed the players, drawing a finger around their neck. Most of its mechanics were still present in ''Among Us'', but the team wanted to "alleviate the need to create an interesting home model and have someone wandering around in a boring environment". So, they decided that the game would be space themed and also added tasks, which, according to Forest Willard, programmer at Innersloth, "changed several times during development".<ref name=":33" /><ref name=":28">{{Cite web|date=January 9, 2021|title=Among Us dev recounts how the game took flight, including early game ideas|url=https://indieworld.nintendo.com/news/#among-us-dev-recounts-how-the-game-took-flight|access-date=February 9, 2021|website=Nintendo}}</ref>

Development began in November 2017.<ref name=":28" /> The game was initially intended to be a mobile-only [[local multiplayer]] game with a single map.<ref name="improb" /> Bromander paused development on Innersloth's other game, ''The Henry Stickmin Collection'', in order to build ''Among Us''<nowiki/>' first map, The Skeld.<ref name="newgroundspod" /> When they began developing the first map, they intended that the ship was always in crisis and that the Impostors could do tasks. However, they found this setup "stressful" and decided that it "[wouldn't leave] much time for detective work and informed meeting conversations".<ref name=":33" /><ref name=":28" /> Willard described [[playtest]]ing as painful and frustrating, as the game would break down during sessions forcing him to send playtesters new builds off of [[Google Play]]. The team tested the game with 8 of their friends and never tested the game with 9 or the maximum of 10 players.<ref name="newgroundspod" /> The game was developed using the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] engine.<ref name='itchpage'/>

The game was released in June 2018 to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] under the AppID of "spacemafia".<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Among Us – Apps on Google Play|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innersloth.spacemafia&hl=en_US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921123231/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innersloth.spacemafia&hl=en_US|archive-date=September 21, 2020|access-date=September 13, 2020|website=[[Google Play]]|language=en}}</ref> Shortly after release, ''Among Us'' had an average player count of 30 to 50 concurrent players.<ref name=":4" /> Bromander blamed the game's poor release on Innersloth being "really bad at marketing".<ref name="improb" /> The team nearly abandoned the project multiple times, but continued work on it due to a "small but vocal player base",<ref name=":14" /> adding in online multiplayer, new tasks, and customization options.<ref name=":14" /> The game was released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] on November 16, 2018.<ref name="improb" /><ref name="outofbeta" /> [[Cross-platform play]] was supported upon release of the Steam version.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Power|first=Tom|date=September 16, 2020|title=Is there crossplay in Among Us?|url=https://www.gamepur.com/guides/is-there-crossplay-in-among-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924153020/https://www.gamepur.com/guides/is-there-crossplay-in-among-us|archive-date=September 24, 2020|access-date=September 21, 2020|website=Gamepur|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Matthews|first=Emma|date=September 10, 2020|title=How crossplay works in Among Us|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/among-us-crossplay-pc-and-mobile/|access-date=September 15, 2020|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|language=en-US|archive-date=September 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921123342/https://www.pcgamer.com/among-us-crossplay-pc-and-mobile/|url-status=live}}</ref> Originally, the game had no audio to avoid revealing hidden information in a local setting,{{Efn|For example, the sound of an Impostor killing a Crewmate could reveal to other Crewmates who the Impostor was.|name=|group=}} and Willard mixed sounds from numerous sound packs to compose the SFX during the game's Steam release.<ref name="newgroundspod">{{Cite web|title=#27 – Innersloth|url=https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/972286|language=en|access-date=October 20, 2020}}</ref>

=== Console releases ===
Amid its popularity, Innersloth considered releasing the game to [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] consoles, but encountered a problem in implementing player communication, since standard text-based or voice-based chat seemed unusable. They considered a system similar to the "quick comms" system from ''[[Rocket League]]'', as well as the possibility of developing an entirely new communication system for the game.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /> Versions of the game for Xbox consoles were later announced.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-02-06|title=Here's everything you need to know about Among Us for Xbox|url=https://www.windowscentral.com/among-us-xbox|access-date=2021-04-20|website=Windows Central}}</ref>

===October 2020 and January 2021 hacks===
In mid-October 2020, a hacker known as "Eris Loris" began targeting mainly North American servers. Several players on the ''Among Us'' [[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]] and [[Twitter]] reported this player hacking their lobbies and [[spamming]] in-game chat with promotions for his YouTube channel, links to his Discord server, and controversial political messages.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mukherjee|first=Arnab|date=October 24, 2020|title=Among Us Hacker: Who is Eris Loris & how to respond to his Among Us hack /spam attack – guide|url=https://thesportsrush.com/among-us-hacker-who-is-eris-loris-how-to-respond-to-his-among-us-hack-spam-attack-guide/|access-date=October 25, 2020|website=The SportsRush|language=en-US}}</ref> Eris Loris also threatened to personally hack players that refused to subscribe to his YouTube channel.

A ''Eurogamer'' report from October 23, 2020, features an interview with a person claiming to be Eris Loris, conducted via the Discord server from one of the links provided in the hacked games. In the interview, Loris claims he created the bot responsible for the hacks "in only six hours", and had enlisted up to 50 volunteers to form a [[botnet]] which boosted the strength of their attacks. Loris claimed that the hack impacted 4.9 million players in 1.5 million games. He also added that the hacks were part of a publicity stunt to influence players to vote for [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election]].<ref name=":22" />

Innersloth added an in-game message warning players about the hacks on October 22,<ref name=":22" /> and released a statement on Twitter the next day. They said they were "super aware" of the hacking issue, and stated that an "emergency server update" would be pushed out to combat the hacks.

Leana Hafer from ''[[IGN]]'' stated in her verdict on the game: "I don't have any sus that this will be the last game of its breed to make a splash, since we’re already seeing its influence on even mega-games like Fortnite". As a negative point, she pointed out some technical problems, such as the difficulty of finding rooms that aren't already full or are a long way from getting there. She also lamented the lack of "mechanic to punish players who rage-quit when they don't get to play as impostor, or are caught dead to rights in the middle of a murder".<ref name="IGNReview">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/among-us-review|title=Among Us Review|date=December 22, 2020|website=[[IGN]]|last=Hafer|first=Leana}}</ref> Tiraxa of ''[[Jeuxvideo.com]]'' was more critical of the game, lamenting the lack of an inbuilt voice chat, server bugs which "[prevent] some from joining the party, in a totally unexplained way", public servers with strangers, which she considered "less entertaining" than private servers with friends, and the large development progress, stating that the game has a "bit of a way to go before it reaches its full potential".<ref name="JXV" /> The mobile version of the game, although being free-to-play, was criticized. Osange of ''Bonus Stage'' called the presence of ads and in-app purchases of cosmetic changes that are mostly available for free on the PC version "nonsense". He also called the PC version "stable" but also stated that the Android version is "a device-by-device situation".<ref name=":27" />

The Nintendo Switch version received some criticism. William Antonieli of ''[[Insider Inc.|Insider]]'' said that the Switch controls give "many tasks a satisfying game response". However, he also stated that most of the tasks could be "done quickly with the Switch's touchscreen control", which can only be used when the console is in handheld mode. He noted that many of the game's tasks are difficult to complete using a gamepad, which is required when the console is connected to a larger screen, and considered this version "inferior" to the PC and mobile versions.<ref name=":34">{{Cite web|last=Antonelli|first=William|date=December 23, 2020|title='Among Us' is the biggest game of 2020, but don't play it on the Nintendo Switch|url=https://www.insider.com/among-us-nintendo-switch-game-review-2020-12|access-date=February 17, 2021|website=Insider}}</ref> He also stated that the communication system is "frustrating", as using the joystick to select letters is "slow", and said the fact that the game has support for multiplayer across multiple platforms gives Switch players "immediate disadvantage".<ref name=":34" /> PJ O'Reilly of ''Nintendo Life'' noted that the Switch lacked much of the additional content available on other platforms, such as skins, which he called a "shame".<ref name="NintendoLife" />

[[Epic Games]] featured a community-created game mode in ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' in December 2020 called "The Spy Within", which had very similar mechanics to ''Among Us'', in which among ten players, the others have to complete tasks to earn enough coins within a limited time while trying to deduce which two players are trying to sabotage that effort.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2020/12/15/22176360/fortnite-new-limited-time-mode-among-us-impostor-spy-within | title = Fortnite's new limited time mode is basically Among Us | first = Austen | last = Goslin  |date = December 15, 2020 | access-date = August 18, 2021 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> Epic later added another (official and internally-developed) limited mode to ''Fortnite'' called "Impostors" in August 2021, which was recognized as even a closer take on ''Among Us'', as the same basic mechanics as "The Spy Within" were used, but now taking place within an underground bunker with a layout similar to the ''Among Us'' map. Innersloth responded in frustration to this mode, which gave no credit to Innersloth. Innersloth's co-founder Marcus Bromander stated "Is it really that hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?", while studio representative Callum Underwood said that Innersloth was open to collaborations, "Just ask and if you follow some basic rules it’s usually fine".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/22630673/fortnite-impostors-among-us-ripoff-copyright-sue-patent | title = Among Us developers push back on Fortnite's 'Impostors' mode | first=  Owen | last = Good | date= August 18, 2021 | access-date = August 18, 2021 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> In an October 2021 blog posting, Epic Games did credit Innersloth and ''Among Us'' as inspirations for the "Impostors" mode.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-12-epic-games-now-credits-among-us-innersloth-as-inspiration-for-fortnites-imposters-mode | title = Epic Games now credits Among Us' Innersloth as inspiration for Fortnite's Impostors mode | first = Tom | last = Phillips | date = October 12, 2021 | access-date = October 12, 2021 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref>
