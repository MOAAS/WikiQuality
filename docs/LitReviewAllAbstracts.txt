Wikipedia is considered as the largest knowledge repository in the history of humanity and plays a crucial role in modern daily life. Assigning the correct quality class to Wikipedia articles is an important task in order to provide guidance for both authors and readers of Wikipedia. The manual review cannot cope with the editing speed of Wikipedia. An automatic classification is required to classify the quality of Wikipedia articles. Most existing approaches rely on traditional machine learning with manual feature engineering, which requires a lot of expertise and effort. Furthermore, it is known that there is no general perfect feature set because information leak always occurs in feature extraction phase. Also, for each language of Wikipedia, a new feature set is required. In this paper, we present an approach relying on deep learning for quality classification of Wikipedia articles. Our solution relies on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) which is an endto-end learning technique that eliminates disadvantages of feature engineering. Our approach learns directly from raw data without human intervention and is language-neutral. Experimental results on English, French and Russian Wikipedia datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art solutions. The old dream of a universal repository containing all the human knowledge and culture is becoming possible through the Internet and the Web. Moreover, this is happening with the direct collaborative, participation of people. Wikipedia is a great example. It is an enormous repository of information with free access and edition, created by the community in a collaborative manner. However, this large amount of information, made available democratically and virtually without any control, raises questions about its relative quality. In this work we explore a significant number of quality indicators, some of them proposed by us and used here for the first time, and study their capability to assess the quality of Wikipedia articles. Furthermore, we explore machine learning techniques to combine these quality indicators into one single assessment judgment. Through experiments, we show that the most important quality indicators are the easiest ones to extract, namely, textual features related to length, structure and style. We were also able to determine which indicators did not contribute significantly to the quality assessment. These were, coincidentally, the most complex features, such as those based on link analysis. Finally, we compare our combination method with state-of-the-art solution and show significant improvements in terms of effective quality prediction. The quality evaluation of Thai Wikipedia articles relies on user consideration. There are increasing numbers of articles every day therefore the automatic evaluation method is needed for user. Components of Wikipedia articles such as headers, pictures, references, and links are useful to indicate the quality of articles. However readers need complete content to cover all of concepts in that article. The concept features are investigated in this work. The aim of this research is to classify Thai Wikipedia articles into two classes namely high-quality and low-quality class. Three article domains (Biography, Animal, and Place) are testes with decision tree and Naïve Bayes. We found that Naïve Bayes gets high TP Rate compared to decision tree in every domain. Moreover, we found that the concept feature plays an important role in quality classification of Thai Wikipedia articles. The great popularity of Wikipedia makes it one of the dominant knowledge source around the World. However, since one of the core principles of Wikipedia is being open for anyone to maintain it, Wikipedia cannot fully ensure the reliability of its articles, and thus sometimes suffered criticism for containing low-quality information. It is therefore essential to assess the quality of Wikipedia articles automatically. In this paper we describe how we approach that problem by using a psycho-lexical resource, i.e., the Language Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary. By training a classifier on different LIWC categories, we discuss the implications of each category for Wikipedia quality assessment. Wikipedia is a great example of large scale collaboration, where people from all over the world together build the largest and maybe the most important human knowledge repository in the history. However, a number of studies showed that the quality of Wikipedia articles is not equally distributed. While many articles are of good quality, many others need to be improved. Assessing the quality of Wikipedia articles is very important for guiding readers towards articles of high quality and suggesting authors and reviewers which articles need to be improved. Due to the huge size of Wikipedia, an effective automatic assessment method to measure Wikipedia articles quality is needed. In this paper, we present an automatic assessment method of Wikipedia articles quality by analyzing their content in terms of their format features and readability scores. Our results show improvements both in terms of accuracy and information gain compared with other existing approaches. With the development of Web 2.0 technologies, people have gone from being mere content users to content generators. In this context, the evaluation of the quality of (potential) information available online has become a crucial issue. Nowadays, one of the biggest online resources that users rely on as a knowledge base is Wikipedia. The collaborative aspect at the basis of Wikipedia can let to the possible creation of low-quality articles or even misinformation if the process of monitoring the generation and the revision of articles is not performed in a precise and timely way. For this reason, in this paper, the problem of automatically evaluating the quality of Wikipedia contents is considered, by proposing a supervised approach based on Machine Learning to perform the classification of articles on qualitative bases. With respect to prior literature, a wider set of features connected to Wikipedia articles has been taken into account, as well as previously unconsidered aspects connected to the generation of a labeled dataset to train the model, and the use of Gradient Boosting, which produced encouraging results. Wikipedia is becoming increasingly critical in helping people obtain information and knowledge. Its leading advantage is that users can not only access information but also modify it. However, this presents a challenging issue: how can we measure the quality of a Wikipedia article? The existing approaches assess Wikipedia quality by statistical models or traditional machine learning algorithms. However, their performance is not satisfactory. Moreover, most existing models fail to extract complete information from articles, which degrades the model’s performance. In this article, we first survey related works and summarise a comprehensive feature framework. Then, state-of-the-art deep learning models are introduced and applied to assess Wikipedia quality. Finally, a comparison among deep learning models and traditional machine learning models is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The models are compared extensively in terms of their training and classification performance. Moreover, the importance of each feature and the importance of different feature sets are analysed separately. This research provides a method for quality assessment of peer-produced content in knowledge repositories using a complementary view of collaboration. Using the definition of collaboration as the action of working with someone to produce something, we identify the aspects of collaboration that the present research on online communities does not consider. To this end, we introduce and define the concept of implicit collaboration and then identify two dimensions and four possible areas of collaboration. In each area, we identify the relevant social network that captures collaboration. Using customized measures on each of the networks that capture various aspects of collaboration, we quantify the utility of implicit collaboration in assessing article quality. Experiments conducted on the complete population of graded English language Wikipedia articles show that all the identified measures improve the predictive accuracy of the existing models by 11.89 percent while improving the class-wise precision by 9-18 percent and the class-wise recall by 5-26 percent. We also find that our method complements the existing quality assessment approaches well. Our research has implications for developing automated quality assessment methods for peer-produced content using big data and social networks. Wikipedia is an online, free, multi-language, and collaborative encyclopedia, currently one of the most significant information sources on the web the open nature of Wikipedia contributions raises concerns about the quality of its information. Previous studies have addressed this issue using manual evaluations and proposing generic measures for quality assessment. In this work, we focus on the quality of health-related content. For this purpose, we use general and health-specific features from Wikipedia articles to propose health-specific metrics. We evaluate these metrics using a set of Wikipedia articles previously assessed by WikiProject Medicine. We conclude that it is possible to combine generic and specific metrics to determine health-related content's information quality these metrics are computed automatically and can be used by curators to identify quality issues. Along with the explored features, these metrics can also be used in approaches that automatically classify the quality of Wikipedia health-related articles. As Wikipedia became the largest human knowledge repository, quality measurement of its articles received a lot of attention during the last decade. Most research efforts focused on classification of Wikipedia articles quality by using a different feature set. However, so far, no 'golden feature set' was proposed. In this paper, we present a novel approach for classifying Wikipedia articles by analysing their content rather than by considering a feature set. Our approach uses recent techniques in natural language processing and deep learning, and achieved a comparable result with the state-of-the-art. Wikipedia, "the free encyclopedia", now contains over two million English articles, and is widely regarded as a high-quality, authoritative encyclopedia. Some Wikipedia articles, however, are of questionable quality, and it is not always apparent to the visitor which articles are good and which are bad. We propose a simple metric - word count - for measuring article quality. In spite of its striking simplicity, we show that this metric significantly outperforms the more complex methods described in related work. Wikipedia provides an information quality assessment model with criteria for human peer reviewers to identify featured articles. For this classification task "Is an article featured or not?" we present a machine learning approach that exploits an article's character trigram distribution. Our approach differs from existing research in that it aims to writing style rather than evaluating meta features like the edit history. The approach is robust, straightforward to implement, and outperforms existing solutions. We underpin these claims by an experiment design where, among others, the domain transferability is analyzed. The achieved performances in terms of the F-measure for featured articles are 0.964 within a single Wikipedia domain and 0.880 in a domain transfer situation. This paper discusses an approach to modeling and measuring information quality of Wikipedia articles. The approach is based on the idea that the quality of Wikipedia articles with distinctly different profiles needs to be measured using different information quality models. We report on our initial study, which involved two categories of Wikipedia articles: " stabilized" (those, whose content has not undergone major changes for a significant period of time) and "controversial" (the articles, which have undergone vandalism, revert wars, or whose content is subject to internal discussions between Wikipedia editors). We present simple information quality models and compare their performance on a subset of Wikipedia articles with the information quality evaluations provided by human users. Our experiment shows, that using special-purpose models for information quality captures user sentiment about Wikipedia articles better than using a single model for both categories of articles. Effective information quality analysis needs powerful yet easy ways to obtain metrics. The English version of Wikipedia provides an extremely interesting yet challenging case for the study of Information Quality dynamics at both macro and micro levels. We propose seven IQ metrics which can be evaluated automatically and test the set on a representative sample of Wikipedia content. The methodology of the metrics construction and the results of tests, along with a number of statistical characterizations of Wikipedia articles, their content construction, process metadata and social context are reported.
